High quality paper, appreciated by reviewers, likely to be of substantial interest to the community. It's worth an oral to facilitate a group discussion.
Important problem (analyzing the properties of emergent languages in multi-agent reference games), a number of interesting analyses (both with symbolic and pixel inputs), reaching a finding that varying the environment and restrictions on language result in variations in the learned communication protocols (which in hindsight is that not surprising, but that's hindsight). While the pixel experiments are not done with real images, it's an interesting addition the literature nonetheless.
This paper presents a sampling inference method for learning in multi-modal demonstration scenarios. Reference to imitation learning causes some confusion with the IRL domain, where this terminology is usually encountered. Providing a real application to robot reaching, while a relatively simple task in robotics, increases the difficulty and complexity of the demonstration. That makes it impressive, but also difficult to unpick the contributions and reproduce even the first demonstration. It's understandable at a meeting on learning representations that the reviewers wanted to understand why existing methods for learning multi-modal distributions would not work, and get a better understanding of the tradeoffs and limitations of the proposed method. The CVAE comparison added to the appendix during the rebuttal period just pushed this paper over the bar. The demonstration is simplified, so much easier to reproduce, making it more feasible others will attempt to reproduce the claims made here.
The paper presents a modification of the Winograd convolution algorithm that reduces the number of multiplications in a forward pass of a CNN with minimal loss of accuracy. The reviewers brought up the strong results, the readability of the paper, and the thoroughness of the experiments. One concern brought up was the applicability to deeper network structures. This was acknowledged by the authors to be a subject of future work. Another issue raised was the question of theoretical vs. actual speedup. Again, this was acknowledged by the authors to be an eventual goal but subject to further systems work and architecture optimizations. The reviewers were consistent in their support of the paper. I follow their recommendation: Accept.
The paper proposes a unique network architecture that can learn divide-and-conquer strategies to solve algorithmic tasks, mimicking a class of standard algorithms. The paper is clearly written, and the experiments are diverse. It also seems to point in the direction of a wider class of algorithm-inspired neural net architectures.
The reviewers concerns regarding novelty and the experimental evaluation have been resolved accordingly and all recommend acceptance. I would recommend removing the term "unsupervised" in clustering, as it is redundant. Clustering is, by default, assumed to be unsupervised. <sep> There is some interest in extending this to non-vision domains, however this is beyond the scope of the current work.
Thank you for submitting you paper to *CONF*. The reviewers are all in agreement that the paper is suitable for publication, each revising their score upwards in response to the revision that has made the paper stronger. <sep> The authors may want to consider adding a discussion about whether the simple standard Gaussian prior, which is invariant under transformation by an orthogonal matrix, is a sensible one if the objective is to find disentangled representations. Alternatives, such as sparse priors, might be more sensible if a model-based solution to this problem is sought.
Thank you for submitting you paper to *CONF*. The idea is simple, but easy to implement and effective. The paper examines the performance fairly thoroughly across a number of different scenarios showing that the method consistently reduces variance. How this translates into final performance is complex of course, but faster convergence is demonstrated and the revised experiments in table 2 show that it can lead to improvements in accuracy.
This paper analyzes mathematically why weights of trained networks can be replaced with ternary weights without much loss in accuracy. Understanding this is an important problem, as binary or ternary weights can be much more efficient on limited hardware, and we've seen much empirical success of binarization schemes. This paper shows that the continuous angles and dot products are well approximated in the discretized network. The paper concludes with an input rotation trick to fix discretization failures in the first layer. <sep> Overall, the contribution seems substantial, and the reviewers haven't found any significant issues. One reviewer wasn't convinced of the problem's importance, but I disagree here. I think the paper will plausibly be helpful for guiding architectural and algorithmic decisions. I recommend acceptance.
Meta score: 6 <sep> The paper approaches the problem of identifying out-of-distribution data by modifying the objective function to include a generative term. Experiments on a number of image datasets. <sep> Pros: <sep> - clearly expressed idea, well-supported by experimentation <sep> - good experimental results <sep> - well-written <sep> Cons: <sep> - slightly limited novelty <sep> - could be improved by linking to work on semi-supervised learning approaches using GANs <sep> The authors note that *CONF* submission 267 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1VGkIxRZ) covers similar ground to theirs.
This paper presents a new multi-document summarization task of trying to write a wikipedia article based on its sources. Reviewers found the paper and the task clear to understand and well-explained. The modeling aspects are clear as well, although lacking justification. Reviewers are split on the originality of the task, saying that it is certainly big, but wondering if that makes it difficult to compare with. The main split was the feeling that "the paper presents strong quantitative results and qualitative examples. " versus a frustration that the experimental results did not take into account extractive baselines or analysis. However the authors provide a significantly updated version of the work targeting many of these concerns, which does alleviate some of the main issues. For these reasons, despite one low review, my recommendation is that this work be accepted as a very interesting contribution.
The reviewers find the work interesting and well made, but are concerned that *CONF* is not the right venue for the work. I will recommend that the paper be accepted, but ask the authors to add the NMT results to the main paper (any other non-synthetic applications they could add would be helpful).
This paper adapts (Nachum et al 2017) to continuous control via TRPO. The work is incremental (not in the dirty sense of the word popular amongst researchers, but rather in the sense of "building atop a closely related work"), nontrivial, and shows empirical promise. The reviewers would like more exploration of the sensitivity of the hyper-parameters.
Some reviewers seem to assign novelty to the compression and classification formulation; however, semi-supervised autoencoders have been used for a long time. Taking the compression task more seriously as is done in this paper is less explored. <sep> The paper provides some extensive experimental evaluation and was edited to make the paper more concise at the request of reviewers. One reviewer had a particularly strong positive rating, due to the quality of the presentation, experiments and discussion. I think the community would like this work and it should be accepted.
A well written paper proposing some reasonable approaches to counter adversarial images. Proposed approaches include non-differentiable and randomized methods. Anonymous commentators pushed upon and cleared up some important issues regarding white, black and gray "box" settings. The approach appears to be a plausible defence strategy. One reviewers is a hold out on acceptance, but is open to the idea. The authors responded to the points of this reviewer sufficiently. The AC recommends accept.
This paper explores what might be characterized as an adaptive form of ZoneOut. <sep> With the improvements and clarifications added to the paper during the rebuttal the paper could be accepted.
The paper presents an interesting view of ResNets and the findings should be of broad interest. R1 did not update their score/review, but I am satisfied with the author response, and recommend this paper for acceptance.
Initially this paper received mixed reviews. After reading the author response, R1 and and R3 recommend acceptance. <sep> R2, who recommended rejecting the paper, did not participate in discussions, did not respond to author explanations, did not respond to AC emails, and did not submit a final recommendation. This AC does not agree with the concerns raised by R2 (e.g. I don't find this model to be unprincipled). <sep> The concerns raised by R1 and R3 were important (especially e.g. comparisons to NMS) and the authors have done a good job adding the required experiments and providing explanations. <sep> Please update the manuscript incorporating all feedback received here, including comparisons reported to the concurrent *CONF* submission on counting.
this work adapts cycle GAN to the problem of decipherment with some success. it's still an early result, but all the reviewers have found it to be interesting and worthwhile for publication.
this submission proposes an efficient parametrization of a recurrent neural net by using two transition functions (one large and one small) to reduce the amount of computation (though, without actual improvement on GPU.) the reviewers found the submission very positive. <sep> please, do not forget to include all the result and discussion on the proposed approach's relationship to VCRNN which was presented at the same conference just a year ago.
Paper presents a way in which linear RNNs can be computed (fprop, bprop) using parallel scan. They show big improvements in speedups and show application on really long sequences. Reviews were generally favorable.
+ Empirically convincing and clearly explained application: a novel deep learning architecture and approach is shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art in unsupervised anomaly detection. <sep> - No clear theoretical foundation and justification is provided for the approach <sep> - Connexion and differentiation from prior work on simulataneous learning representation and fitting a Gaussian mixture to it would deserve a much more thorough discussion / treatment.
This paper initially received borderline reviews. The main concern raised by all reviewers was a limited experimental evaluation (synthetic only). In rebuttal, the authors provided new results on the CelebA dataset, which turned the first reviewer positive. The AC agrees there is merit to this approach, and generally appreciates the idea of compositional concept learning.
The paper extends the earlier work on Prototypical networks to semi-supervised setting. Reviewers largely agree that the paper is well-written. There are some concerns on the incremental nature of the paper wrt to the novelty aspect but in the light of reported empirical results which show clear improvement over earlier work and given the importance of the topic, I recommend acceptance.
The paper received mostly positive comments from experts. To summarize: <sep> Pros: <sep> -- The paper provides complex counterparts for typical architectures / optimization strategies used by real valued networks. <sep> Cons: <sep> -- Although the authors include plots explaining how nonlinearities transform phase, intuition about how phase gets processed can be improved. <sep> -- Improving evaluations: Wisdom et al. computes log magnitude; real valued networks may not be suited for computing real / complex numbers which have a large dynamic range, like the complex spectra. So please compare performance by estimating magnitude as in Wisdom et al. <sep> -- Please add computational cost, in terms of the number of multiplies and adds, to the final version of the paper. <sep> I am recommending that the paper be accepted based on these reviews.
The idea of using wavelet pooling is novel and will bring many interesting research work in this direction. But more thorough experimental justification such as those recommended by the reviewers would make the paper better. Overall, the committee feels this paper will bring value to the conference.
Pros: <sep> + Clearly written paper. <sep> + Easily implemented algorithm that appears to have excellent scaling properties and can even improve on validation error in some cases. <sep> + Thorough evaluation against the state of the art. <sep> Cons: <sep> - No theoretical guarantees for the algorithm. <sep> This paper belongs in *CONF* if there is enough space.
Authors propose an approach to generation of adversarial examples that jointly examine the effects to classification within a local neighborhood, to yield a more robust example. This idea is taken a step further for defense, whereby the classification boundaries within a local neighborhood of a presented example are examined to determine if the data was adversarially generated or not. <sep> Pro: <sep> - The idea of examining local neighborhoods around data points appears new and interesting. <sep> - Evaluation and investigation is thorough and insightful. <sep> - Authors made reasonable attempts to address reviewer concerns. <sep> Con <sep> - Generation of adversarial examples an incremental improvement over prior methods
The paper provides an interesting take on GAN training based on Coulomb dynamics. The proposed formulation is theoretically well motivated and authors provide guarantees for convergence. Reviewers agree that the theoretical analysis is interesting but are not completely impressed by the results. The method addresses mode collapse issue but still lacks in sample quality. Nevertheless, reviewers agree that this is a good step towards the understanding of GAN training.
PROS: <sep> 1. Interesting and clearly useful idea <sep> 2. The paper is clearly written. <sep> 3. This work doesn't seem that original from an algorithmic point of view since Reed & De Freitas (2015) and Cai et. al (2017) among others have considered using execution traces. However the application to program repair is novel (as far as I know). <sep> 4. This work can be very useful for an educational platform though a limitation is the need for adding instrumentation print statements by hand. <sep> CONS: <sep> 1. The paper has some clarity issues which the authors have promised to fix. <sep> ---
PROS: <sep> 1. Overall, the paper is well-written, clear in its exposition and technically sound. <sep> 2. With some caveats, an independent team concluded that the results were "largely reproducible" <sep> 3. The key idea is a smart evolution scheme. It circumvents the traditional tradeoff between search space size and complexity of the found models. <sep> 4. The implementation seems technically sound. <sep> CONS: <sep> 1. The results were a bit over-stated (the authors promise to correct) <sep> 2. Could benefit from more comparison with other approaches (e.g. RL)
PROS: <sep> 1. well-written and clear <sep> 2. added extra comparison to dagger which shows success <sep> 3. SOTA results on open ai benchmark problem and comparison to relevant related work (Shi 2017) <sep> 4. practical applications <sep> 5. created new dataset to test harder aspects of the problem <sep> CONS: <sep> 1. the algorithmic novelty is somewhat limited <sep> 2. some indication of scalability to real-world tasks is provided but it is limited
This paper extends last year's paper on PATE to large-scale, real-world datasets. The model works by training multiple "teacher" models -- one per dataset, where a dataset might be for example, one user's data -- and then distilling those models into a student model. The teachers are all trained on disjoint data. Differential privacy is guaranteed by aggregating the teacher responses with added noise. The paper shows improved teacher consensus by adding more concentrated noise and allowing the teacher to simply not respond to a student query. The new results beat the old results convincingly on a variety of measures. <sep> Quality and Clarity: The reviewers and I thought the paper was well written. <sep> Originality: In some sense this work is incremental, extending and improving the existing PATE framework. However, the extensions and new analysis are non-trivial and the results are good. <sep> PROS: <sep> 1. Well written though difficult in places for somebody like myself who is not involved in this area. <sep> 2. Much improved scalability to real datasets <sep> 3. Good theoretical analysis supporting the extensions. <sep> 4. Comparison to related work (with a new comparison to UCI medical datasets used in the original paper and better results) <sep> CONS: <sep> 1. Perhaps a little dense for the non-expert
The effectiveness of active learning techniques for training modern deep learning pipelines in a label efficient manner is certainly a very well motivated topic. The reviewers unanimously found the contributions of this paper to be of interest, particularly nice empirical gains over several natural baselines.
Reviewers agree that the paper is well done and addresses an interesting problem, but uses fairly standard ML techniques. <sep> The authors have responded to rebuttals with careful revisions, and improved results.
This paper offers a theoretical and empirical analysis of the expressivity of RNNs, in particular in comparison to TT decomposition. The reviewers argued the results was interesting and important, although there were issues with clarity of some of the explanations. More critical reviewers argued the comparison basis with CP networks was not "fair" in that their shallowness restricted their expressivity w.r.t. TT. The experiments could be strengthened by making the explanations surrounding the set up clearer. This paper is borderline acceptable, and would have benefited from a more active discussion between the reviewers and the author. From reading the reviews and the author responses, I am leaning towards recommending acceptance to the main conference rather than the workshop track, as it is important to have theoretical work of this nature discussed at *CONF*.
This is a very interesting paper that also seems a little underdeveloped. As noted by the reviewers, it would have been nice to see the idea applied to domains requiring function approximation to confirm that it can scale -- the late addition of Freeway results is nice, but Freeway is also by far the simplest exploration problem in the Atari suite. There also seems to be a confusion between methods such as UCB, which explore/exploit, and purely exploitative methods. The case gamma_E > 0 is also less than obvious. Given the theoretical leanings of the paper, I would strongly encourage the authors to focus on deriving an RMax-style bound for their approach.
The reviewers agree that the problem of learning learning credit assignment from terminal rewards is interesting, and that the presented approach is promising. There are some concerns regarding the rigor and correctness of the theoretical results, and I ask the authors to improve those aspects of the paper. I also ask the authors to the result figures easier to read. The chosen colors are not ideal and the use of log-scale x-axis is not standard. Finally, including DAgger in the same plot is confusing assuming that DAgger user more information.
Given the changes to the paper, the reviewers agree that the paper meets the bar for publication at *CONF*. There are some concerns regarding the practical impact on CPUs and GPUs. I ask the authors to clearly discuss the impact on different hardware. One can argue if adaptive quantization techniques are helpful, then there is a chance that future hardware will support them. All of the experiments are conducted on toy datasets. Please consider including some experiments on Imagenet as well.
Dear authors, <sep> The reviewers all appreciated your work and agree that this a very good first step in an interesting direction.
This paper is a timely application of linear algebra to propose a method for reducing catastrophic interference by training a new task in a subspace of the parameter space using conceptors. The conceptors are deployed in the backprop, making this a valuable alternative to recent continual learning methods such as EWC. The paper is clearly written and the results give a clear validation of the method. The reviewers agree as to the merits of the paper.
The paper provides a useful analysis of the role of gradient penalties and the performance of the proposed approach in semi-supervised cases.
The pros and cons of the paper under consideration can be summarized below: <sep> Pros: <sep> * Reviewers thought the underlying model is interesting and intuitive <sep> * Main contributions are clear <sep> Cons: <sep> * There is confusion between keywords and topics, which is leading to a somewhat confused explanation and lack of clear comparison with previous work. Because of this, it is hard to tell whether the proposed approach is clearly better than the state of the art. <sep> * Typos and grammatical errors are numerous <sep> As the authors noted, the concerns about the small dataset are not necessarily warranted, but I would encourage the authors to measure the statistical significance of differences in results, which would help alleviate these concerns. <sep> An additional comment: it might be worth noting the connections to query-based or aspect-based summarization, which also have a similar goal of performing generation based on specific aspects of the content. <sep> Overall, the quality of the paper as-is seems to be somewhat below the standards of *CONF* (although perhaps on the borderline), but the idea itself is novel and results are good. I am not recommending it for acceptance to the main conference, but it may be an appropriate contribution for the workshop track.
This submission is a continuation of a line of theoretical work that seeks to characterize optimization landscapes of neural networks by the presence or absence of spurious local minima. As the number of critical points grows combinatorially for larger networks, it is very challenging to show such results. The present submission extends slightly previous work by considering two hidden units and their proof technique goes beyond that of Brutzkus and Globerson, 2017, potentially leading to more interesting results if they can be extended to more complex networks. <sep> The setting of two hidden units is quite limited - far from any practical setting. If this were the stepping stone to proving optimality of certain optimization strategies for more complex networks, this may be of some interest, but it seems doubtful. One indication is given in Sec. 7 / Fig. 1 in which it is shown that for even quite small numbers of hidden units, spurious local optima do occur and are reached 40% of the time for random initializations even with only 11 nodes.
The paper analyzes neural network with hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. The reviewers find the results incremental and not "surprising", and also complained about comparison with previous work. I think the topic is very pertinent, and definitely more relevant compared to studying multi-layer linear networks. Hence, I recommend the paper be presented in the workshop track.
The paper nicely unifies previous results and develops the property of local openness. While interesting, I find the application to multi-layer linear networks extremely limiting. There appears to be a sub-field in theory now focusing on solely multi-layer linear networks which is meaningless in practice. I can appreciate that this could give rise to useful proof techniques and hence, I am recommending it to the workshop track with the hope that it can foster more discussions and help researchers move away from studying multi-layer linear networks.
the problem is interesting, and the approach is also interesting. however, the reviewers have found that this manuscript would benefit from more experiments, potentially involving some real data (even at least for evaluation) in addition to largely synthetic data sets used in the submission. i also agree with them and encourage authors to consider this option.
The author's propose to use swish and show that it performs significantly better than Relus on sota vision models. Reviewers and anonymous ones counter that PRelus should be doing quite well too. Unfortunately, the paper falls in the category where it is hard to prove the utility of the method through one paper alone, and broader consensus relies on reproduction by the community. As a results, I'm going to recommend publishing to a workshop for now.
The paper introduces an interesting family of two-player zero-sum games with tunable complexity, called Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games, as a new domain for RL. The authors report on extensive empirical results using a wide variety of training methods, including supervised learning and several flavors of RL (PPO, A2C, DQN) as well as single-agent vs. multi-agent training. The reviewers also appear to agree that the method appears to be technically correct, clearly written, and easy to read. <sep> A drawback of the paper is that it does not make a *significant* contribution to the field. In combing through the reviewer comments, none of them identify a significant contribution. Even in the text of the paper, the authors do not anywhere claim to have made a significant contribution. As the paper is still interesting, the committee would like to recommend this for the workshop track. <sep> Pros: <sep> Interesting domain with tunable complexity <sep> High-quality extensive empirical results <sep> Writing is clear <sep> Cons: <sep> Lacks a significant contribution <sep> Appears to overlook self-play, the dominant RL training paradigm for decades (multiagent training appears to be related but different) <sep> Per Reviewer3, "I remain unconvinced that these games are good general tests for Deep RL
This paper turned out to be quite difficult to call. My take on the pros/cons is: <sep> 1. The research topic, how and why humans can massively outperform DQN, is unanimously viewed as highly interesting by all participants. <sep> 2. The authors present an original human subject study, aiming to reveal whether human outperformance is due to human knowledge priors. The study is well conceived and well executed. I consider the study to be a contribution by itself. <sep> 3. The study provides prima facie evidence that human priors play a role in human performance, by changing the visual display so that the priors cannot be used. <sep> 4. However, the study is not definitive, as astutely argued by AnonReviewer2. Experiments using RL agents (with presumably no human priors) yield behavior that is similar to human behavior. So it is possible that some factor other than human prior may account for the behavior seen in the human experiments. <sep> 5. It would indeed be better, as argued by AnonReviewer2, to use some information-theoretic measure to distinguish the normal game from the modified games. <sep> 6. The paper has been substantially improved and cleaned up from the original version. <sep> 7. AnonReviewer1 provided some thoughtful detailed discussion of how the authors may be overstating the conclusions that one can draw from the paper. <sep> Bottom line: Given the procs and cons of the paper, the committee recommends this for workshop.
Authors present a method for representing DNA sequence reads as one-hot encoded vectors, with genomic context (expected original human sequence), read sequence, and CIGAR string (match operation encoding) concatenated as a single input into the framework. Method is developed on 5 lung cancer patients and 4 melanoma patients. <sep> Pros: <sep> - The approach to feature encoding and network construction for task seems new. <sep> - The target task is important and may carry significant benefit for healthcare and disease screening. <sep> Cons: <sep> - The number of patients involved in the study is exceedingly small. Though many samples were drawn from these patients, pattern discovery may not be generalizable across larger populations. Though the difficulty in acquiring this type of data is noted. <sep> - (Significant) Reviewer asked for use of public benchmark dataset, for which authors have declined to use since the benchmark was not targeted toward task of ultra-low VAFs. However, perhaps authors could have sourced genetic data from these recommended public repositories to create synthetic scenarios, which would enable the broader research community to directly compare against the methods presented here. The use of only private datasets is concerning regarding the future impact of this work. <sep> - (Significant) The concatenation of the rows is slightly confusing. It is unclear why these were concatenated along the column dimension, rather than being input as multiple channels. This question doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper. <sep> Given the pros and cons, the commitee recommends this interesting paper for workshop.
This method makes a connection between evolutionary and variational methods in a particular model. This is a good contribution, but there has been little effort to position it in comparison to standard methods that do the same thing, showing relative strengths and weaknesses. <sep> Also, please shorten the abstract.
The reviewers all outlined concerns regarding novelty and the maturity of this work. It would be helpful to clarify the relation to doubly stochastic kernel machines as opposed to random kitchen sinks, and to provide more insight into how this stochasticity helps. Finally, the approach should be tried on more difficult image datasets.
The problem addressed here is an important one: What is a good evaluation metric for generative models? A good selection of popular metrics are analyzed for their appropriateness for model selection of GANs. Two popular approaches are recommended: the kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1-NN) two-sample test. This seems reasonable, but the present work was not recommended for acceptance by 2 reviewers who raised valid concerns. <sep> From a readability perspective, it would be nice to simply list the answer to question (1) directly in the introduction. One must read more than a few pages to get to the answer of why the metrics that are advocated were picked. It need not read like a mystery. <sep> R4: "The evaluations rely on using a pre-trained imagenet model as a representation. The authors point out that different architectures yield similar results for their analysis, however it is not clear how the biases of the learned representations affect the results. The use of learned representations needs more rigorous justification" <sep> R2: "First, it only considers a single task for which GANs are very popular. Second, it could benefit from a deeper (maybe theoretical analysis) of some of the questions." - the first point of which is also related to a concern of R4. <sep> Given the overall high selectivity of *CONF*, the present submission falls short.
The reviewers were unanimous in their assessment that the paper was not ready for publication in *CONF*. Their concerns included: <sep> - lack of novelty over Niepert, Ahmed, Kutzkov, ICML 2016 <sep> - The approach learns combinations of graph kernels and its expressive capacity is thus limited <sep> - The results are close to the state of the art and it is not clear whether any improvement is statistically significant. <sep> The authors have not provided a response to these concerns.
This paper presents a memory architecture for RL based on reservoir sampling, and is meant to be an alternative to RNNs. The reviewers consider the idea to be potentially interesting and useful, but have concerns about the mathematical justification. They also point out limitations in the experiments: in particular, use of artificial toy problems, and a lack of strong baselines. I don't think the paper is ready for *CONF* publication in its current form.
meta score: 4 <sep> This paper proposes an activation function, called displaced ReLU (DReLU), to improve the performance of CNNs that use batch normalization. <sep> Pros <sep> - good set of experiments using CIFAR, with good results <sep> - attempt to explain the approach using expectations <sep> Cons <sep> - theoretical explanations are not so convincing <sep> - limited novelty <sep> - CIFAR is relatively limited set of experiments <sep> - does not compare with using bn after relu, which is now well-studied and seems to address the motivation of this paper (and thus questions the conclusions)
Meta score: 4 <sep> The paper concerns the development of a density network for estimating uncertainty in recommender systems. The submitted paper is not very clear and it is hard to completely understand the proposed method from the way it is presented. This makes assessing the contribution of the paper difficult. <sep> Pros: <sep> - addresses an interesting and important problem <sep> - possible novel contribution <sep> Cons: <sep> - poorly written, hard to understand precisely what is done <sep> - difficult to compare with the state-of-the-art, not helped by disorganised literature review <sep> - experimentation could be improved <sep> The paper needs more work before being ready for publication.
The reviewers point out that most of the results are already known and are not novel. There are also issues with the presentation. Studying only depth 2 and depth 3 networks is very limiting.
The authors propose a technique for weight pruning that leaves block diagonal weights, instead of unstructured sparse weights, leading to faster inference. However, the experiments demonstrating the quality of the pruned models are insufficient. The authors also discuss connections to random matrix theory; but these connections are not worked out in detail.
While the reviewers considered the basic idea of adding supervision intermediate to differentiable programming style architectures to be interesting and worthy of effort, they were unsure if <sep> 1: the proposed abstractions for discussing ntm and nram are well motivated/more generally applicable <sep> 2: the methods used in this work to give intermediate supervision are more generally applicable
This paper resulted in significant discussion -- both between R2 and the authors, and between the AC, PCs, and other solicited experts. <sep> The problem of language grounding (and instruction following) in virtual environments is clearly important, this work was one of the first in the recent resurgence, and the goal of understand what the agents have learned is clearly noble and important. In terms of raw recommendations, the majority reviewer recommendation is negative, but since concerns raised by R2 seemed subjective (which in principle is not a problem), out of abundance of caution, we solicited additional input. Unfortunately, we received feedback consistent with the concerns raised here: <sep> -- The lack of generality of the behavior found. Even if we ignore the difficult question of why the agent prefers what it does, it's unclear how the conclusions here generalize much farther than the model and environment used; the manuscript does not provide any novel or transferable principals of the form "this kind of bias in the environment leads to this kind of bias in models with these properties". <sep> -- We realize even providing that concrete a statement might be hard, but also missing are thorough comparisons to other kinds of models (e.g. non-deep, as asked by R1) to establish that this is a general phenomenon. <sep> Ultimately, there is a sense that this is too narrow an analysis, too soon. If there was one architecture for learning embodied agents in 3d environments that was clearly successful and useful, then studying its properties might be interesting (even crucial). But the dust in this space isn't settled. Our current agents are fairly poor, and so the impact of understanding the biases of a specific model trained in a specific environment seems fairly low. <sep> Finally -- this not taken into consideration in making the decision -- it is not okay to list personal homepage domains (that may reveal author identity to ACs) as conflict domains; those are meant for institutional conflicts/domains.
This paper received divergent ratings (7, 3, 3). While there is value in thorough evaluation papers, this manuscript has significant presentation issues. As all three reviewers point out, the way it is currently written, it misrepresents the claims made by Mirowski et al 2016 and over-reaches in its findings. Unfortunately, we cannot make a decision on what the manuscript may look like in future once these issues are fixed, and must reject.
This paper studies to what extent adversarial training affects the properties of adversarial examples in object classification. <sep> Reviewers found the work going in the right direction, but agreed that it needs further evidence/focus in order to constitute a significant contribution to the *CONF* community. In particular, the AC encourages authors to relate their work to the growing body of (mostly concurrent) work on robust optimization and adversarial learning. For the above reasons, the AC recommends rejection at this time.
This paper addresses the question of how to solve image super-resolution, building on a connection between sparse regularization and neural networks. <sep> Reviewers agreed that this paper needs to be rewritten, taking into account recent work in the area and significantly improving the grammar. The AC thus recommends rejection at this time.
The paper proposes a new convolutional network architecture, called CrescendoNet. Whilst achieving competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, the accuracy of the proposed model on CIFAR-100 is substantially lower than that of state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters; the paper presents no experimental results on ImageNet. The proposed architecture does not provide clear new insights or successful new design principles. This makes it unlikely the current manuscript will have a lot of impact.
The paper presents a boosting method and uses it to train an ensemble of convnets for image classification. The paper lacks conceptual and empirical comparisons with alternative boosting and ensembling methods. In fact, it is not even clear from the experimental results whether or not the proposed method outperforms a simple baseline model that averages the predictions of T independently trained convolutional networks.
The authors propose to use identity + some weights in the recurrent connections to prevent vanishing gradients. The reviewers found the experiments to have weak baselines, weakening the claims of the paper.
+ The paper proposes an interesting empirical measure of "learnability" of a trained network: how well the predictive function it represents can be learned by another network. And shows it empirically seems to correlate with better generalization. <sep> - The work is purely empirical: it features no theory relating this learnability to generalization <sep> - Learnability measure is somewhat ad-hoc with moving parts left to be specified (learning network, data splits, ...) <sep> - as pointed out by a reviewer, learnability doesn't really provide any answers for now. <sep> - the work would be much stronger if it went beyond a mere correlation study, and if learnability considerations allowed to derive a new approach/regularization scheme that was convincingly shown to improve generalization.
Proposed network compression method offers limited technical novelty over existing approaches, and empirical evaluations do not clearly demonstrate an advantage over current state-of-the-art. <sep> Paper presentation quality also needs to be improved.
The paper makes overly strong claims, too weakly supported by a hard to follow and insufficiently rigorous mathematical argument. Connections with a large body of relevant prior literature are missing.
The paper received borderline-negative scores (6,5,5) with R1 and R2 having significant difficulty with the clarity of the paper. Although R3 was marginally positive, they pointed out that the experiments are "extremely weak". The AC look at the paper and agrees with R3 on this point. Therefore the paper cannot be accepted in its current form. The experiments and clarity need work before resubmission to another venue.
The paper received scores of 5,5,5, with the reviewers agreeing the paper was marginally below the acceptance threshold. The main issue, raised by both R2 and R3 was that connection between representation learning in deep nets and coding theory was not fully justified/made. With no reviewer advocating acceptance, it is not possible to accept the paper unfortunately.
The paper received weak scores: 4,4,5. R2 complained about clarity. R3's point about the lack of fully connected layers in current SOA deepnets is very valid and the authors response far from convincing. Unfortunately the major revision provided by the authors was not commented on by the reviewers, but many of the major shortcomings of the work still remain. <sep> Generally, the paper is below the acceptance threshold, so cannot be accepted.
This paper tackles a very important problem: evaluating natural language generation. The paper presents an overview of existing unsupervised metrics, and looks at how they correlate with human evaluation scores. This is important work and the empirical conclusions are useful to the community, but the datasets used are too limited and the authors agree it would be better to use newer bigger and more diverse datasets suggested by reviewers for drawing more general conclusions. This work would indeed be much stronger if it relied on better, more recent datasets; therefore publication as is seems premature.
While using self-play for training a goal-oriented dialogue system makes sense, the contribution of this paper compared to previous work (that the paper itself cites) seems too minor, and the limitations of using toy synthetic data further weaken the work.
The paper builds on earlier work by Wang et al (2015) on Visual Concepts (VCs) and explores the use of VCs for few-shot learning setting for novel classes. <sep> The work, as pointed out by two reviewers is somewhat incremental in nature, with main novelty being the demonstration of utilities of VCs for few shot learning. This would not have been a big limitation if the paper had a carefully conducted empirical evaluation providing insights on the effect of various configuration settings/hyperparameters on the performance in few shot learning, which two of the reviewers (Anon3, Anon2) state are missing. The paper falls short of the acceptance threshold in its current form. <sep> PS: The authors posted a github link to the code on Jan 12 which may potentially compromise the anonymity of the submission (though it was after all the reviews were already in) https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJ_QxP1AZ&noteId=BJaIDpBEM
Pros <sep> -- Competitive results on LibriSpeech. <sep> Cons <sep> -- Limited novelty, and lacks enough comparisons. <sep> -- Comparison with other end-to-end approaches, and on other commonly used datasets, like WSJ, missing. <sep> -- Gated convnets have already been proposed. <sep> -- Letter based systems have been shown to be competitive to phone based systems. <sep> -- Optimization criterion is quite similar to lattice-free MMI proposed by Povey et al., but with a letter based LM and a slightly different HMM topology. <sep> Given the cons pointed out by reviews, the AC is recommending that the paper be rejected.
Pros: <sep> + The idea of end-to-end training that simultaneously learns the weights and appropriate precision for those weights is very appealing. <sep> Cons: <sep> - Experimental results are far from the state-of-the-art, which makes the empirical evaluation unconvincing. <sep> - More justification is needed for the update of the number of bits using the sign of the gradient.
The reviewers agree that the authors have made an interesting contribution studying the effect of data augmentation, but they also agree that the claims made by the paper require a broader empirical study beyond the limited number of tasks surveyed in the current revision. I urge the authors to follow this advice and see what they find.
This paper presents a neural compositional model for visual question answering. The overall idea may be exciting but the committee agrees with the evaluation of Reviewer 1: the experimental section is a bit thin and it only evaluates against an artificial dataset for visual QA that does not really need a knowledge base. It would have been better to evaluate on more traditional question answering settings where the answer can be retrieved from a knowledge base (WebQuestions, Free917, etc.), and then compare with state of the art on those.
All reviewers agree that the contribution of this paper, a new way of training neural nets to execute Monte-Carlo Tree Search, is an appealing idea. For the most part, the reviewers found the exposition to be fairly clear, and the proposed architecture of good technical quality. Two of the reviewers point out flaws in implementing in a single domain, 10x10 Sokoban with four boxes and four targets. Since their training methodology uses supervised training on approximate ground-truth trajectories derived from extensive plain MCTS trials, it seems unlikely that the trained DNN will be able to generalize to other geometries (beyond 10x10x4) that were not seen during training. Sokoban also has a low branching ratio, so that these experiments do not provide any insight into how the methodology will scale at much higher branching ratios. <sep> Pros: Good technical quality, interesting novel idea, exposition is mostly clear. Good empirical results in one very limited domain. <sep> Cons: Single 10x10x4 Sokoban domain is too limited to derive any general conclusions. <sep> Point for improvement: The paper compares performance of MCTSnet trials vs. plain MCTS trials based on the number of trials performed. This is not an appropriate comparison, because the NN trials will be much more heavyweight in terms of CPU time, and there is usually a time limit to cut off MCTS trials and execute an action. It will be much better to plot performance of MCTSnet and plain MCTS vs. CPU time used.
All three reviewers are in agreement that this paper is not ready for *CONF* in its current state. Given the pros/cons, the committee feels the paper is not ready for acceptance in its current form.
The paper presents an approach for learning continuous-valued vector representations combining multiple input feature sets of different types, in both unsupervised and supervised settings. The revised paper is a merger of the original submission and another *CONF* submission. This meta-review takes into account all of the comments on both submissions and revisions. <sep> The merged paper is an improvement over the two separate ones. However, the contribution over previous work is still a bit unclear. It still does not sufficiently compare to/discuss in the context of other recent work on combining multiple feature groups. <sep> The experiments are also quite limited. The idea is introduced as extremely general, but the experiments focus on a small number of specific tasks, some of them non-standard.
The paper addresses the training time of CNNs, in the common setting where a CNN is trained on one domain and then used to extract features for another domain. The paper proposes to speed up the CNN training step via a particular proposed training schedule with a reduced number of epochs. Training time of the pre-trained CNN is not a huge concern, since this is only done once, but optimizing training schedules is a valid and interesting topic of study. However, the approach here does not seem novel; it is typical to adjust training schedules according to the desired tradeoff between training time and performance. The experimental validation is also thin, and the writing needs improvement.
This paper applies a form of recurrent autoencoder for a specific type of industrial sensor signal analysis. The application is very narrow and the data set is proprietary. The approach is not clearly described, but seems very straightforward and is not placed in context of prior work. It is therefore not clear how to evaluate the contribution of the method. The authors have revised the paper to include more details and prior work, but it still needs a lot more work on all of the above dimensions before it can make a significant contribution to the *CONF* community.
Pro: <sep> - Interesting approach to tie together reinforcement Q-learning with CNN for prediction and reward function learning in predicting downstream effects of chemical structures, while providing relevant areas for decision-making. <sep> Con: <sep> - Datasets are small, generalizability not clear. <sep> - Performance is not high (although performance wasn't the goal necessarily) <sep> - Sometimes test performance is higher than training performance, making results questionable. <sep> - Should include comparison to other wrapper-based combinatorial approaches. <sep> - Too targeted an appeal/audience (better for chemical journal)
Authors present a method for modeling neurodegenerative diseases using a multitask learning framework that considers "censored regression" problems (to model where the outputs have discrete values and ranges). Given the pros/cons, the committee feels this paper is not ready for acceptance in its current state. <sep> Pro: <sep> - This approach to modeling discrete regression problems is interesting and may hold potential, but the evaluation is not in a state where strong meaningful conclusions can be made. <sep> Con: <sep> - Reviewers raise multiple concerns regarding evaluation and comparison standards for tasks. While authors have added some model comparisons in response, in other areas comparisons don't appear complete. For example, when using MRI data, networks compared all use features derived from images, rather than systems that may learn from images themselves. Authors claim dataset is too small to learn directly from pixels in this data (in comments), but transfer learning and data augmentation have been successfully applied to learn from datasets of this size. In addition, new multitask techniques in the imaging domain have also been presented that dynamically learn the network structure, rather than relying on a hand-crafted neural network design. How this approach would compare is not addressed.
Reviewers unanimous in assessment that manuscript has merits, but does not satisfy criteria for publication. <sep> Pros: <sep> - Potentially novel application of neural networks to survival analysis with competing risks, where only one terminal event from one risk category may be observed. <sep> Cons: <sep> - Incomplete coverage of other literature. <sep> - Architecture novelty may not be significant. <sep> - Small performance gains (though statistically significant)
This paper does not meet the bar for *CONF* - neither in terms of the quality of the write-up, nor in experimental design. The two confident reviewers agree to reject the paper, the weak accept comes from a less confident reviewer who did not write a good review at all. The rebuttal does not change this assessment.
PROS: <sep> 1. All the reviewers thought that the work was interesting and showed promise <sep> 2. The paper is relatively well written <sep> CONS: <sep> 1. Limited experimental evaluation (just MNIST) <sep> The reviewers were all really on the fence about this but in the end felt that while the idea was a good one and the authors were responsive in their rebuttal, the experimental evaluation needed more work.
The reviewers are unanimous in their opinion that the theoretical results in this paper are of limited novelty and significance. Several parts of the paper are not presented clearly enough. As such the paper is not ready for *CONF*-2018 acceptance.
The paper proposes a method to map input probability distributions to output probability distributions with few parameters. They show the efficacy of their method on synthetic and real stock data. After revision they seemed to have added another dataset, however, it is not carefully analyzed like the stock data. More rigorous experimentation needs to be done to justify the method.
The paper proposes a new model called differential decision tree which captures the benefits of decision trees and VAEs. They evaluate the method only on the MNIST dataset. The reviewers thus rightly complain that the evaluation is thus insufficient and one also questions its technical novelty.
The proposed conditional variance regularizer looks interesting and the results show some promise. However, as the reviewers pointed out, the connection between the information-theoretic argument provided and the final form of the regularizer is too tenuous in its current form. Since this argument is central to the paper, the authors are urged to either provide a more rigorous derivation or motivate the regularizer more directly and place more emphasis on its empirical evaluation.
The reviewers agreed that the paper was too long (more than twice the recommended page limit not counting the appendix) and difficult to follow. They also pointed out that its central idea of learning the noise distribution in a VAE was not novel. While the shortened version uploaded by the authors looks like a step in the right direction, it was not sufficient to convince the reviewers.
The reviewers are in agreement, that the paper is a big hard to follow and incorrect in places, including some claims not supported by experiments.
The authors present GraphVAE, a method for fitting a generative deep model, a variational autoencoder, to small graphs. Fitting deep learning models to graphs remains challenging (although there is relevant literature as brought up by the reviewers and anonymous comments) and this paper is a strong start. <sep> In weighing the various reviews, AnonReviewer3 is weighed more highly than AnonReviewer1 and AnonReviewer2 since that review is far more thorough and the reviewer is more expert on this subject. Unfortunately, the review from AnonReviewer1 is extremely short and of very low confidence. As such, this paper sits just below the borderline for acceptance. In general, the main criticisms of the paper are that some claims are too strong (e.g. non-differentiability of discrete structures), treatment of related work (missing references, etc.) and weak experiments and baselines. The consensus among the reviews (even AnonReviewer2) is that the paper is preliminary. The paper is close, however, and addressing these concerns will make the paper much stronger. <sep> Pros: <sep> - Proposes a method to build a generative deep model of graphs <sep> - Addresses a timely and interesting topic in deep learning <sep> - Exposition is clear <sep> Cons: <sep> - Treatment of related literature should be improved <sep> - Experiments and baselines are somewhat weak <sep> - "Preliminary" <sep> - Only works on rather small graphs (i.e. O(k^4) for graphs with k nodes)
The reviewers agreed that this paper is not quite ready for publication at *CONF*. One of the reviewers thought the paper was well written and easy to follow while the two others said the opposite. One of the main criticisms was issues with the composition. The paper seems to lack a clear formal explanation of the problem and the proposed methodology. The reviewers in general weren't convinced by the experiments, complaining about the lack of a required baseline and that the proposed method doesn't seem to significantly help in the experiment presented. <sep> Pros: <sep> - The proposed idea is interesting <sep> - The problem is timely and of interest to the community <sep> - Addresses multiple important problems at the intersection of ML and RL in sequence generation <sep> Cons: <sep> - Novel but somewhat incremental <sep> - The experiments are not compelling (i.e. the results are not strong) <sep> - A necessary baseline is missing <sep> - Significant issues with the writing - both in terms of clarity and correctness.
Regarding clarity, while the paper definitely needs work if it is to be resubmitted to an ML venue, different revisions would be appropriate for a physics audience. And given the above comment, any suggested changes are likely to be superfluous.
The reviewers agree that the paper studies and interesting problem with an interesting approach. The reviewers raised some concerns regarding the theoretical and empirical results. The authors have made changes to the paper, but given the theoretical nature of the paper and the extent of changes, another review is needed before publication.
Dear authors, <sep> The reviewers appreciated your work and recognized the importance of theoretical work to understand the behaviour of deep nets. That said, the improvement over existing work (especially Montufar, 2017) is minor. This, combined with the limited attraction of such work, means that the paper will not be accepted. <sep> I acknowledge the major modifications done but it is up to the reviewers to decide whether or not they agree to re-review a significantly updated version.
This paper looks at building new density estimation methods and new methods for tranformations and autoregressive models. The request from reviewers for comparison improves the paper. These models have seen a wide range of applications and have been highly successful, needing the added benefits shown and their potential impact to be expanded further.
This is an interesting paper and addresses an important problem of neural networks with memory constrains. New experiments have been added that add to the paper, but the full impact of the paper is not yet realised, needing further exploration of models of current practice, wider set of experiments and analysis, and additional clarifying discussion.
The subject of model evaluation will always be a contentious one, and the reviewers were not yet fully-convinced by the discussion. The points you bring up at the end of your rresponse already point to directions for improvement as well as a greater degree of precision and control.
Even though the results are very preliminary we still accept them for the purpose of fostering interesting discussions.
The manuscript presents a promising new algorithm for learning geometrically-inspired embeddings for learning hierarchies, partial orders, and lattice structures. The manuscript builds on the build on the box lattice model, extending prior work by relaxing the box embeddings via Gaussian convolutions. This is shown to be particularly effective for non-overlapping boxes, where the previous method fail. <sep> The primary weakness identified by reviewers was the writing, which was thought to be lacking some context, and may be difficult to approach for the non-domain expert. This can be improved by including an additional general introduction. Otherwise, the manuscript was well written. <sep> Overall, reviewers and AC agree that the general problem statement is timely and interesting, and well executed. In our opinion, this paper is a clear accept.
The authors posit and investigate a hypothesis -- the "lottery ticket hypothesis" -- which aims to explain why overparameterized neural networks are easier to train than their sparse counterparts. Under this hypothesis, randomly initialized dense networks are easier to train because they contain a larger number of "winning tickets". <sep> This paper received very favorable reviews, though there were some notable points of concern. The reviewers and the AC appreciated the detailed and careful experimentation and analysis. However, there were a couple of points of concern raised by the reviewers: 1) the lack of experiments conducted on large-scale tasks and models, and 2) the lack of a clear application of the idea beyond what has been proposed previously. <sep> Overall, this is a very interesting paper with convincing experimental validation and as such the AC is happy to accept the work.
This method proposes a criterion (SNIP) to prune neural networks before training. The pro is that SNIP can find the architecturally important parameters in the network without full training. The con is that SNIP only evaluated on small datasets (mnist, cifar, tiny-imagenet) and it's uncertain if the same heuristic works on large-scale dataset. Small datasets can always achieve high pruning ratio, so evaluation on ImageNet is quite important for pruning work. The reviewers have consensus on accept. The authors are recommended to compare with previous work [1][2] to make the paper more convincing. <sep> [1] Song Han, Jeff Pool, John Tran, and William Dally. Learning both weights and connections for efficient neural network. NIPS, 2015. <sep> [2] Yiwen Guo, Anbang Yao, and Yurong Chen. Dynamic network surgery for efficient dnns. NIPS, 2016.
The reviewers acknowledge the value of the careful analysis of Gaussian encoder/decoder VAE presented in the paper. The proposed algorithm shows impressive FID scores that are comparable to those obtained by state of the art GANs. The paper will be a valuable addition to the *CONF* program.
All reviewers agree that the proposed method interesting and well presented. The authors' rebuttal addressed all outstanding raised issues. Two reviewers recommend clear accept and the third recommends borderline accept. I agree with this recommendation and believe that the paper will be of interest to the audience attending *CONF*. I recommend accepting this work for a poster presentation at *CONF*.
Reviewers are in a consensus and recommended to accept after engaging with the authors. Please take reviewers' comments into consideration to improve your submission for the camera ready.
This paper proposes an approach for imitation learning from unsegmented demonstrations. The paper addresses an important problem and is well-motivated. Many of the concerns about the experiments have been addressed with follow-up comments. We strongly encourage the authors to integrate the new results and additional literature to the final version. With these changes, the reviewers agree that the paper exceeds the bar for acceptance. Thus, I recommend acceptance.
The reviewers unanimously agreed that the paper was a significant advance in the field of machine learning on graph-structured inputs. They commented particularly on the quality of the research idea, and its depth of development. The results shared by the researchers are compelling, and they also report optimal hyperparameters, a welcome practice when describing experiments and results. <sep> A small drawback the reviewers highlighted is the breadth of the content in the paper, which gave the impression of a slight lack of focus. Overall, the paper is a clear advance, and I recommend it for acceptance.
Lean in favor <sep> Strengths: The paper tackles the difficult problem of automatic robot design. The approach uses graph neural <sep> networks to parameterize the control policies, which allows for weight sharing / transfer to new policies even <sep> as the topology changes. Understanding how to efficiently explore through non-differentiable changes to the body <sep> is an important problem (AC). The authors will release the code and environments, which will be useful in an area where there are <sep> currently no good baselines (AC). <sep> Weaknesses: There are concerns (particularly R2, R1) over the lack of a strong baseline, and with the results <sep> being demonstrated on a limited number of environments (R1) (fish, 2D walker). In response, the authors clarified the nomenclature and <sep> description of a number of the baselines, and added others. AC: there is no submitted video (searches for "video" on the PDF text <sep> produces no hits); this is seen by the AC as being a real limitation from the perspective of evaluation. <sep> AC agrees with some of the reviewer remarks that some of the original stated claims are too strong. <sep> AC: the simplified fluid model of Mujoco (http://mujoco.org/book/computation.html#gePassive) is <sep> unable to model the fluid state, in particular the induced fluid vortices that are responsible for a <sep> good portion of fish locomotion, i.e., "Passive and active flow control by swimming fishes and <sep> mammals" and other papers. Acknowledging this kind of limitation will make the paper stronger, not weaker; <sep> the ML community can learn from much existing work at the interface of biology and fluid mechancis. <sep> There remain points of contention, i.e., the sufficiency of the baselines. However, the reviewers R2 and R3 have <sep> not responded to the detailed replies from the authors, including additional baselines (totaling 5 at present) <sep> and pointing out that baselines such as CMA-ES (R2) in a continuous space and therefore do not translate in any obvious way <sep> to the given problem at hand. <sep> On balance, with the additional baselines and related clarifications, the AC feels that this paper makes a <sep> useful and valid contribution to the field, and will help establish a benchmark in an important area. <sep> The authors are strongly encouraged to further state caveats and limitations, and to emphasize why some <sep> candidate baseline methods are not readily applicable.
The authors present a theoretical and practical study on low-precision training of neural networks. They introduce the notion of variance retention ratio (VRR) that determines the accumulation bit-width for <sep> precise tailoring of computation hardware. Empirically, the authors show that their theoretical result extends to practical implementation in three standard benchmarks. <sep> A criticism of the paper has been certain hyperparameters that a reviewer found to be chosen rather arbitrarily, but I think the reviewers do a reasonable job in rebutting it. <sep> Overall, there is consensus that the paper presents an interesting framework and does both practical and empirical analysis, and it should be accepted.
The proposed method suggests a way to do robust conditional image generation with GANs. The premise is to make the image to image translation model resilient to noise by leveraging structure in the output space, with an unsupervised "pathway". <sep> In general, the qualitative results seem reasonable on a a number of datasets, including those suggested by reviewers. The method appears simple, novel and easy to try. The main concerns seem to be that the idea is maybe too simple, but I'm not particularly bothered by that. The authors showed it working well on a variety of tasks (synthetic and natural), provide SSIM numbers that look compelling (despite SSIM's short-comings) and otherwise give compelling arguments for the technical soundness of the approach. <sep> Thus, I recommend acceptance.
I agree with the reviewers that this is a strong contribution and provides new insights, even if it doesn't quite close the problem. <sep> p.s.: It seems that centering the weight matrices at initialization is a key idea. The authors note that Dziugaite and Roy used bounds that were based on the distance to initialization, but that their reported numerical generalization bounds also increase with the increasing network size. Looking back at that work, they look at networks where the size increases by a very large factor (going from e.g. 400,000 parameters roughly to over 1.2 million, so a factor of 2.5), at the same time the bound increases by a much smaller factor. The type of increase also seems much less severe than those pictured in Figures 3/5. Since Dzugate and Roy's bounds involved optimization, perhaps the increase there is merely apparent.
The reviewers that provided extensive and technically well-justified reviews agreed that the paper is of high quality. The authors are encouraged to make sure all concerns of these reviewers are properly addressed in the paper.
While the reviews of this paper were somewhat mixed (7,6,4), I ended up favoring acceptance because of the thorough author responses, and the novelty of what is being examined. <sep> The reviewer with a score of 4, argues that this work is not a good fit for iclr, but, although tailoring new metrics may not be a common area that is explored, I don't believe that it's outside the range of iclr's interest, and therefore also more unique.
Strong paper on hierarchical RL with very strong reviews from people expert in this subarea that I know well.
AR1 is concerned about lack of downstream applications which show that higher-order interactions are useful and asks why not to model higher-order interactions for all (a,b) pairs. AR2 notes that this submission is a further development of Arora et al. and is satisfied with the paper. AR3 is the most critical regarding lack of explanations, e.g. why linear addition of two word embeddings is bad and why the corrective term proposed here is a good idea. The authors suggest that linear addition is insufficient when final meaning differs from the individual meanings and show tome quantitative results to back up their corrective term. <sep> On balance, all reviewers find the theoretical contributions sufficient which warrants an accept. The authors are asked to honestly reflect all uncertain aspects of their work in the final draft to reflect legitimate concerns of reviewers.
The overall consensus after an extended discussion of the paper is that this work should be accepted to *CONF*. The back-and-forth between reviewers and authors was very productive, and resulted in substantial clarification of the work, and modification (trending positive) of the reviewer scores.
Pros: <sep> - A useful and well-structured dataset which will be of use to the community <sep> - Well-written and clear (though see Reviewer 2's comment concerning the clarity of the model description section) <sep> - Good methodology <sep> Cons: <sep> - There is a question about why a new dataset is needed rather than a combination of previous datasets and also why these datasets couldn't be harvested from school texts directly. Presumably it would've been a lot more work but please address the issue in your rebuttal. <sep> - Evaluation: Reviewer 3 is concerned that the evaluation should perhaps have included more mathematics-specific models (a couple of which are mentioned in the text). On the other hand, Reviewer 2 is concerned that the specific choices (e.g. "thinking steps") made for the general models are non-standard in seq-2-seq models. I haven't heard about the thinking step approach but perhaps it's out there somewhere. It would be helpful generally to have more discussion about the reasoning involved in these decisions. <sep> I think this is a useful contribution to the community, well written and thoughtfully constructed. I am tentatively accepting this paper with the understanding that you will engage directly with the reviewers to address their concerns about the evaluation section. Please in particular use the rebuttal period to focus on the clarity of the model description and the motivation for the particular models chosen. Also consider adding additional experiments to allay the concerns of the reviewers.
The paper proposes a new method that builds on the Bayesian modelling framework for GANs and is supported by a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation that shows very promising results. All reviewers agree, that the method is interesting and the results are convincing, but that the model does not really fit in the standard Bayesian setting due to a data dependency of the priors. I would therefore encourage the authors to reflect this by adapting the title and making the differences more clear in the camera ready version.
This paper makes the intriguing observation that a density model trained on CIFAR10 has higher likelihood on SVHN than CIFAR10, i.e., it assigns higher probability to inputs that are out of the training distribution. This phenomenon is also shown to occur for several other dataset pairs. This finding is surprising and interesting, and the exposition is generally clear. The authors provide empirical and theoretical analysis, although based on rather strong assumptions. Overall, there's consensus among the reviewers that the paper would make a valuable contribution to the proceedings, and should therefore be accepted for publication.
Alternating minimization is surprisingly effective for low-rank matrix factorization and dictionary learning problems. Better theoretical characterization of these methods is well motivated. This paper fills up a gap by providing simultaneous guarantees for support recovery as well as coefficient estimates for linearly convergence to the true factors, in the online learning setting. The reviewers are largely in agreement that the paper is well written and makes a valuable contribution. The authors are advised to address some of the review comments around relationship to prior work highlighting novelties.
This paper introduces a class of deep neural nets that provably have no bad local valleys. By constructing a new class of network this paper avoids having to rely on unrealistic assumptions and manages to provide a relatively concise proof that the network family has no strict local minima. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this type of network yields reasonable experimental results on some benchmarks. The reviewers identified issues such as missing measurements of the training loss, which is the actual quantity studied in the theoretical results, as well as some issues with the presentation of the results. After revisions the reviewers are satisfied that their comments have been addressed. This paper continues an interesting line of theoretical research and brings it closer to practice and so it should be of interest to the *CONF* community.
Reviewers agree the paper should be accepted. <sep> See reviews below.
The paper proposes a novel differential way to output brush strokes, taking a few ideas from model-based learning. The method is efficient in that one can train it in an unsupervised manner and does not require paired data. The strengths of the paper are the qualitative results that demonstrate nice interpolations among other things, on a number of datasets (esp. post-rebuttal). <sep> The weaknesses of the paper are the writing (which I think is relatively easy to improve if the authors make an honest effort) and some of the quantitative evaluation. I would encourage the authors to get in touch with the SPIRAL paper authors in order to get access to the SPIRAL generated MNIST test data and then perhaps the classification metric could be updated. <sep> In summary, from the discussion, the major points of contention were the somewhat lacking initial evaluation (which was fixed to a large extent) and the quality of writing (which could be fixed more). I believe the submission is genuinely novel, interesting (esp. the usage of world model-like techniques) and valuable for the *CONF* audience so I recommend acceptance.
This paper presents a method for measuring the degree to which some representation for a composed object effectively represents the pieces from which it is composed. All three authors found this to be an important topic for study, and found the paper to be a limited but original and important step toward studying this topic. However, two reviewers expressed serious concerns about clarity, and were not fully satisfied with the revisions made so far. I'm recommending acceptance, but I ask the authors to further revise the paper (especially the introduction) to make sure it includes a blunt and straightforward presentation of the problem under study and the way TRE addresses it. <sep> I'm also somewhat concerned at R2's mention of a potential confound in one experiment. The paper has been updated with what appears to be a fix, though, and R2 has not yet responded, so I'm presuming that this issue has been resolved. <sep> I also ask the authors to release code shortly upon de-anonymization, as promised.
The submission proposes a method to construct adversarial attacks based on deforming an input image rather than adding small peturbations. Although deformations can also be characterized by the difference of the original and deformed image, it is qualitatively and quantitatively different as a small deformation can result in a large difference. <sep> On the positive side, this paper proposes an interesting form of adversarial attack, whose success can give additional insights on the forms of existing adversarial attacks. The experiments on MNIST and ImageNet are reasonably comprehensive and allow interesting interpretation of how the image deforms to allow the attack. The paper is also praised for its clarity, and cleaner formulation compared to Xiao et al. (see below). Additional experiments during rebuttal phase partially answered reviewer concerns, and provided more information e.g. about the effect of the smoothness of the deformation. <sep> There were some concerns that the paper primarly presents one idea, and perhaps missed an opportunity for deeper analysis (R1). R2 would have appreciated more analysis on how to defend against the attack. <sep> A controversial point is the relation / novelty with respect to Xiao et al., *CONF* 2018. As e.g. pointed out by R1: "The paper originates from a document provably written in late 2017, which is before the deposit on arXiv of another article (by different authors, early 2018) which was later accepted to *CONF* 2018 [Xiao and al.]. This remark is important in that it changes my rating of the paper (being more indulgent with papers proposing new ideas, as otherwise the novelty is rather low compared to [Xiao and al.])." <sep> On the balance, all three reviewers recommended acceptance of the paper. Regarding novelty over Xiao et al., even ignoring the arguable precedence of the current submission, the formulation is cleaner and will likely advance the analysis of adversarial attacks.
The paper is well written and easy to follow. The experiments are adequate to justify the usefulness of an identity for improving existing multi-Monte-Carlo-sample based gradient estimators for deep generative models. The originality and significance are acceptable, as discussed below. <sep> The proposed doubly reparameterized gradient estimators are built on an important identity shown in Equation (5). This identity appears straightforward to derive by applying both score-function gradient and reparameterization gradient to the same objective function, which is expressed as an expectation. The AC suspects that this identity might have already appeared in previous publications / implementations, though not being claimed as an important contribution / being explicitly discussed. While that identity may not be claimed as the original contribution of the paper if that suspicion is true, the paper makes another useful contribution in applying that identity to the right problem: improving three distinct training algorithms for deep generative models. The doubly reparameterized versions of IWAE and reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) further show how IWAE and RWS are related to each other and how they can be combined for potentially further improved performance. <sep> The AC believes that the paper makes enough contributions by well presenting the identity in (5) and applying it to the right problems.
The paper presents an adversarial learning framework for active visual tracking, a tracking setup where the tracker has camera control in order to follow a target object. The paper builds upon Luo et al. 2018 and proposes jointly learning tracker and target policies (as opposed to tracker policy alone). This automatically creates a curriculum of target trajectory difficulty, as opposed to the engineer designing the target trajectories. The paper further proposes a method for preventing the target to fast outperform the tracker and thus cause his policy to plateau. Experiments presented justify the problem formulation and design choices, and outperform Luo et al. . The task considered is very important, active surveillance with drones is just one sue case. <sep> A downside of the paper is that certain sentences have English mistakes, such as this one: "The authors learn a policy that maps raw-pixel observation to control signal straightly with a Conv-LSTM network. Not only can it save <sep> the effort in tuning an extra camera controller, but also does it outperform the..." However, overall the manuscript is well written, well structured, and easy to follow. The authors are encouraged to correct any remaining English mistakes in the manuscript.
The paper investigates mixed-integer linear programming methods for neural net robustness verification in presence of adversarial attckas. The paper addresses and important problem, is well-written, presents a novel approach and demonstrates empirical improvements; all reviewers agree that this is a solid contribution to the field.
This paper proposes a novel method of solving inverse problems that avoids direct inversion by first reconstructing various piecewise-constant projections of the unknown image (using a different CNN to learn each) and then combining them via optimization to solve the final inversion. <sep> Two of the reviewers requested more intuitions into why this two stage process would fight the inherent ambiguity. <sep> At the end of the discussion, two of the three reviewers are convinced by the derivations and empirical justification of the paper. <sep> The authors also have significantly improved the clarity of the manuscript throughout the discussion period. <sep> It would be interesting to see if there are any connections between such inversion via optimization with deep component analysis methods, e.g. "Deep Component Analysis via Alternating Direction Neural Networks <sep> " of Murdock et al. , that train neural architectures to effectively carry out the second step of optimization, as opposed to learning a feedforward mapping.
To borrow the succinct summary from R1, "the paper suggests a method for generating representations that are linked to goals in reinforcement learning. More precisely, it wishes to learn a representation so that two states are similar if the <sep> policies leading to them are similar." The reviewers and AC agree that this is a novel and worthy idea. <sep> Concerns about the paper are primarily about the following. <sep> (i) the method already requires good solutions as input, i.e., in the form of goal-conditioned policies, (GCPs) <sep> and the paper claims that these are easy to learn in any case. <sep> As R3 notes, this then begs the question as to why the actionable representations are needed. <sep> (ii) reviewers had questions regarding the evaluations, i.e., fairness of baselines, additional comparisons, and <sep> additional detail. <sep> After much discussion, there is now a fair degree of consensus. While R1 (the low score) still has a remaining issue with evaluation, particularly hyperparameter evaluation, they are also ok with acceptance. The AC is of the opinion that hyperparameter tuning is of course an important issue, but does not see it as the key issue for this particular paper. <sep> The AC is of the opinion that the key issue is issue (i), raised by R3. In the discussion, the authors reconcile the inherent contradiction in (i) based on the need of additional downstream tasks that can then benefit from the actionable representation, and as demonstrated in a number of the evaluation examples (at least in the revised version). The AC believes in this logic, but believes that this should be stated more clearly in the final paper. And it should be explained <sep> the extent to which training for auxiliary tasks implicitly solve this problem in any case. <sep> The AC also suggests nominating R3 for a best-reviewer award.
This paper presents a novel method for synthesizing fluid simulations, constrained to a set of parameterized variations, <sep> such as the size and position of a water ball that is dropped. The results are solid; there is little related <sep> work to compare to, in terms of methods that can "compute"/recall simulations at that speed. <sep> The method is 2000x faster than the orginal simulations. This comes with the caveats that: <sep> (a) the results are specific to the given set of parameterized environments; the method is learning a <sep> compressed version of the original animations; (b) there is a loss of accuracy, and therefore <sep> also a loss of visual plausibility. <sep> The AC notes that the paper should use the *CONF* format for citations, i.e., "(foo et al.)" rather than "(19)". <sep> The AC also suggests that limitations should also be clearly documented, i.e., as seen from the <sep> perspective of those working in the fluid simulation domain. <sep> The principle (and only?) contentious issue relates to the suitability of the paper for the *CONF* audience, <sep> given its focus on the specific domain of fluid simulations. The AC is of two minds on this: <sep> (i) the fluid simulation domain has different characteristics to other domains, and thu <sep> understanding the *CONF* audience can benefit from the specific nature of the predictive problems that <sep> come the fluid simulation domain; new problems can drive new methods. There is a loose connection <sep> between the given work and residual nets, and of course res-nets have also been recently reconceptualized as PDEs. <sep> (ii) it's not clear how much the *CONF* audience will get out of the specific solutions being described; <sep> it requires understanding spatial transformer networks and a number of other domain-specific issues. <sep> A problem with this type of paper in terms of graphics/SIGGRAPH is that it can also be seen as "falling short" <sep> there, simply because it is not yet competitive in terms of visual quality or the generality of <sep> fluid simulators; it really fulfills a different niche than classical fluid simulators. <sep> The AC leans slightly in favor of acceptance, but is otherwise on the fence.
This paper proposes an input-dependent baseline function to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation without adding bias. The approach is novel and theoretically validated, and the experimental results are convincing. The authors addressed nearly all of the reviewer's concerns. I recommend acceptance.
BMIs need per-patient and per-session calibration, and this paper seeks to amend that. Using VAEs and RNNs, it relates sEEG to sEMG, in principle a ten-year old approach, but do so using a novel adversarial approach that seems to work. <sep> The reviewers agree the approach is nice, the statements in the paper are too strong, but publication is recommended. Clinical evaluation is an important next step.
This paper presents good empirical results on an important and interesting task (translation between several language pairs with a single model). There was solid communication between the authors and the reviewers leading to an improved updated version and consensus among the reviewers about the merits of the paper.
The reviewers lean to accept, and the authors clearly put a significant amount of time into their response. I will also lean to accept. However, the comments of reviewer 2 should be taken seriously, and addressed if possible, including an attempt to cut the paper length down.
This paper provides interesting results on convergence and stability in general differentiable games. The theory appears to be correct, and the paper reasonably well written. The main concern is in connections to an area of related work that has been omitted, with overly strong statements in the paper that there has been little work for general game dynamics. This is a serious omission, since it calls into question some of the novelty of the results because they have not been adequately placed relative to this work. The authors should incorporate a thorough discussion on relations to this work, and adjust claims about novelty (and potentially even results) based on that literature.
This heavily disputed paper discusses a biologically motivated alternative to back-propagation learning. In particular, methods focussing on sign-symmetry rather than weight-symmetry are investigated and, importantly, scaled to large problems. The paper demonstrates the viability of the approach. If nothing else, it instigates a wonderful platform for debate. <sep> The results are convincing and the paper is well-presented. But the biological plausibility of the methods needed for these algorithms can be disputed. In my opinion, these are best tackled in a poster session, following the good practice at neuroscience meetings. <sep> On an aside note, the use of the approach to ResNet should be questioned. The skip-connections in ResNet may be all but biologically relevant.
This paper proposes a VAE model with arbitrary conditioning. It is a novel idea, and the model derivation and training approach are technically sound. Experiments are thoughtfully designed and include comparison with latest related works. <sep> R1 and R3 suggested the original version of the paper was lack of comparison with relevant work and the authors provided new experiments in the revision. The rebuttal also addressed a few other concerns about the novelty and clarity raised by R3. <sep> Based on the novel contribution in handling missing feature imputation with VAE, I would recommend to accept the paper. It is worth noticing that there is another submission to *CONF* (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxLl309Ym) that shares a similar idea of constructing the inference network with binary masking, although it is designed for a pre-trained VAE model. <sep> There are still two weaknesses pointed out by R3 that would help improve the paper by addressing them: <sep> 1. The paper does not handle different kinds of missingness beyond missing at random. <sep> 2. VAE model makes the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. <sep> Point 1 would be a good direction for future research, and point 2 is a common problem for all VAE approaches. While the latter should not become a reason to reject the paper, I encourage the authors to take MCMC methods into account in the evaluation section.
The paper proposes an approach to hyperparameter tuning based on bilevel optimization, and demonstrates promising empirical results. Reviewer's concerns seem to be addressed well in rebuttals and extended version of the paper.
The proposed ENorm procedure is a normalization scheme for neural nets whereby the weights are rescaled in a way that minimizes the sum of L_p norms while maintaining functional equivalence. An algorithm is given which provably converges to the globally optimal solution. Experiments show it is complementary to, and perhaps slightly better than, other normalization schemes. <sep> Normalization issues are important for DNN training, and normalization schemes like batch norm, weight norm, etc. have the unsatisfying property that they entangle multiple issues such as normalization, stochastic regularization, and effective learning rates. ENorm is a conceptually cleaner (if more algorithmically complicated) approach. It's a nice addition to the set of normalization schemes, and possibly complementary to the existing ones. <sep> After a revision which included various new experiments, the reviewers are generally happy with the paper. While there's still some controversy over whether it's really better than things like batch norm, I think the paper would be worth publishing even if the results came out negative, since it is a very natural idea which took some algorithmic insight in order to actually execute.
The paper presents a variational inequality perspective on the optimization problem arising in GANs. Convergence of stochastic gradient descent methods (averaging and extragradient variants) is given under monotonicity (or convex) assumptions. In particular, binlinear saddle point problem is carefully studied with batch and stochastic algorithms. Experiments on CIFAR10 with WGAN etc. show that the proposed averaging and extrapolation techniques improve the GAN training in such a nonconvex optimization practices. <sep> General convergence results in the context of general non-monotone VIPs is still an open problem for future exploration. The questions raised by the reviewers are well answered. The reviewers unanimously accept the paper for *CONF* publication.
This paper considers the information bottleneck Lagrangian as a tool for studying deep networks in the common case of supervised learning (predicting label Y from features X) with a deterministic model, and identifies a number of troublesome issues. (1) The information bottleneck curve cannot be recovered by optimizing the Lagrangian for different values of β because in the deterministic case, the IB curve is piecewise linear, not strictly concave. (2) Uninteresting representations can lie on the IB curve, so information bottleneck optimality does not imply that a representation is useful. (3) In a multilayer model with a low probability of error, the only tradeoff that successive layers can make between compression and prediction is that deeper layers may compress more. Experiments on MNIST illustrate these issues, and supplementary material shows that these issues also apply to the deterministic information bottleneck and to stochastic models that are nearly deterministic. There was a substantial degree of disagreement between the reviewers of this paper. One reviewer (R3) suggested that all the conclusions of the paper are the consequence of P(X,Y) being degenerate. The authors responded to this criticism in their response and revision quite effectively, in the opinion of the AC. Because R3 failed to participate in the discussion, this review has been discounted in the final decision. The other two reviewers were considerably more positive about the paper, with one (R1) having basically no criticisms and the other (R2) expression some doubts about the novelty of the observations being made in the paper and their importance for practical machine learning scenarios. Following the revision and discussion, R2 expressed general satisfaction with the paper, so the AC is recommending acceptance. The AC thinks that the final paper would be clearer if the authors were to carefully distinguish between ground-truth labels used in training and the labels estimated by the model for a given input. At the moment, the symbol Y appears to be overloaded, standing for both. Perhaps the authors should place a hat over Y when it is standing for estimated labels?
The paper presents generative models to produce multi-agent trajectories. The approach of using a simple heuristic labeling function that labels variables that would otherwise be latent in training data is novel and and results in higher quality than the previously proposed baselines. <sep> In response to reviewer suggestions, authors included further results with models that share parameters across agents as well as agent-specific parameters and further clarifications were made for other main comments (i.e., baselines that train the hierarchical model by maximizing an ELBO on the marginal likelihood?).
This paper combines probabilistic models, VAEs, and self-organizing maps to learn interpretable representations on time series. The proposed contributions are a novel and interesting combination of existing ideas, in particular, the extension to time-series data by modeling the cluster dynamics. The empirical results show improved unsupervised clustering performance, on both synthetic and real datasets, compared to a number of baselines. The resulting 2D embedding also provides an interpretable visualization. <sep> The reviewers and the AC identified a number of potential weaknesses in the presentation in the original submission: (1) there was insufficient background on SOMs, leaving the readers unable to comprehend the contributions, (2) some of the details about the experiments were missing, such as how the baselines were constructed, (3) additional experiments were needed in regards to the hyper-parameters, such as number of clusters and the weighting in the loss, and (4) Figure 4d required a description of the results. <sep> The revision and the comments by the authors addressed most of these comments, and the reviewers felt that their concerns had been alleviated. <sep> Thus, the reviewers felt the paper should be accepted.
The reviewers all agreed that the problem application is interesting, and that there is little new methodology, but disagreed as to how that should translate into a score. The highest rating seemed to heavily weight the importance of the method to biological application, whereas the lowest rating heavily weighted the lack of technical novelty. However, because the *CONF* call for papers clearly calls out applications in biology, and all reviewers agreed on its strength in that regard, and it was well-written and executed, I would recommend it for acceptance.
Pros: <sep> - a method that obtains convergence results using a using time-dependent (not fixed or state-dependent) softmax temperature. <sep> Cons: <sep> - theoretical contribution is not very novel <sep> - some theoretical results are dubious <sep> - mismatch of Boltzmann updates and epsilon-greedy exploration <sep> - the authors seem to have intended to upload a revised version of the paper, but unfortunately, they changed only title and abstract, not the pdf -- and consequently the reviewers did not change their scores. <sep> The reviewers agree that the paper should be rejected in the submitted form.
This paper proposes a new method for graph representation in sequence-to-sequence models and validates its results on several tasks. The overall results are relatively strong. <sep> Overall, the reviewers thought this was a reasonable contribution if somewhat incremental. In addition, while the experimental comparison has greatly improved from the original version, there are still a couple of less satisfying points: notably the size of the training data is somewhat small. In addition, as far as I can tell all comparisons with other graph-based baselines actually aren't implemented in the same toolkit with the same hyperparameters, so it's a bit difficult to tell whether the gains are coming from the proposed method itself or from other auxiliary differences. <sep> I think this paper is very reasonable, and definitely on the borderline for acceptance, but given the limited number of slots available at *CONF* this year I am leaning in favor of the other very good papers in my area.
The paper proposes a new method for adversarial attacks, MarginAttack, which finds adversarial examples with small distortion and runs faster than the CW baseline, but slower than other methods. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and a broad set of experiments. <sep> In the discussion, a consistent concern has been that, experimentally, the method does not perform noticeably better than previous approaches. The authors mention that the lines are too thick to reveal the difference. It has been pointed out that this might be related to the way the experiments are conducted, but the proposed method still does better than other methods. AnonReviewer1 mentions that the assumptions needed for the theoretical part might be too strong, meaning that the main contribution of the paper is in the experimental side. <sep> The comparisons with other methods and the assumptions made in the theorems seem to have caused quite some confusion and there was a fair amount of discussion. Following the discussion session, AnonReviewer1 updated his rating from 5 to 6 with high confidence. <sep> The referees all rate the paper as not very strong, with one marginally above acceptance threshold and two marginally below the acceptance threshold. <sep> Although the paper seems to propose valuable ideas, and it appears that the discussion has clarified many questions from the initial submission, the paper has not provided a clear, convincing, selling point at this time.
The work presents a method of imposing harmonic structural regularizations to layers of a neural network. While the idea is interesting, the reviewers point out multiple issues. <sep> Pros: <sep> + Interesting method <sep> + Hidden layer coherence tends to improve <sep> Cons: <sep> - Deficient comparisons to baselines or context with other works. <sep> - Insufficient assessment of impact to model performance. <sep> - Lack of strategy to select regularizers <sep> - Lack of evaluation on more realistic datasets
The paper can also improved thorough a more thorough evaluation.
This paper proposes a method for improving robustness to black-box adversarial attacks by replacing the cross-entropy layer with an output vector encoding scheme. The paper is well-written, and the approach appears to be novel. However, Reviewer 4 raises very relevant concerns regarding the experimental evaluation of the method, including (a) lack of robustness without AT in the whitebox case (which is very relevant as we still lack good understanding of blackbox vs whitebox robustness) (b) comparison with Kannan et al and (c) lack of some common strong attacks. Reviewer 1 echoes many of these concerns.
This paper proposes to quantify the uncertainty of neural network models with Beta, Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood. This paper is clearly written with a sound main idea. However, it is a common practice to model different types of data with different likelihood, although the proposed distributions are not usually used for network output. All the reviewers therefore considered this paper to be of limited novelty. Reviewer 2 also had a concern about the mixed experimental results of the proposed method. <sep> Reviewer 3 raised the concern that this paper did not model the uncertainty of prediction from the uncertainty of the model parameters. It is a common consideration in a Bayesian approach and I encourage the authors to discussed different sources of uncertainty in future revisions.
This method proposes a primal approach to minimizing Wasserstein distance for generative models. It estimates WD by computing the exact WD between empirical distributions. <sep> As the reviewers point out, the primal approach has been studied by other papers (which this submission doesn't cite, even in the revision), and suffers from a well-known problem of high variance. The authors have not responded to key criticisms of the reviewers. I don't think this work is ready for publication in *CONF*.
In this work, the authors conduct experiments using variants of RNNs and Gated CNNs on a speech recognition task, motivated by the goal of reducing the computational requirements when deploying these models on mobile devices. <sep> While this is an important concern for practical deployment of ASR systems, the main concerns expressed by the reviewers is that the work lacks novelty. Further, the authors choice to investigate CTC based systems which predict characters. These models are not state-of-the-art for ASR, and as such it is hard to judge the impact of this work on a state-of-the-art embedded ASR system. Finally, it would be beneficial to replicate results on a much larger corpus such as Librispeech or Switchboard. Based on the unanimous decision from the reviewers, the AC agrees that the work, in the present form, should be rejected.
This paper focuses on scaling up neural theorem provers, a link prediction system that combines backward chaining with neural embedding of facts, but does not scale to most real-world knowledge bases. The authors introduce a nearest-neighbor search-based method to reduce the time/space complexity, along with an attention mechanism that improves the training. With these extensions, they scale NTP to modern benchmarks for the task, including ones that combine text and knowledge bases, thus providing explanations for such models. <sep> The reviewers and the AC note the following as the primary concerns of the paper: (1) the novelty of the contributions is somewhat limited, as nearest neighbor search and attention are both well-known strategies, as is embedding text+facts jointly, (2) there are several issues in the evaluation, in particular around analysis of benefits of the proposed work on new datasets. There were a number of other potential weaknesses, such the performance on some benchmarks (Fb15k) and clarity and writing quality of a few sections. <sep> The authors provided significant revisions to the paper that addressed many of the clarity and evaluation concerns, along with providing sufficient comments to better contextualize some of the concerns. However, the concerns with novelty and analysis of the results still hold. Reviewer 3 mentions that it is still unclear in the discussion why the accuracy of the proposed approach matches/outperforms that of NTP, i.e. why is there not a tradeoff. Reviewer 4 also finds the analysis lacking, and feels that the differences between the proposed work and the single-link approaches, in terms of where each excels, are described in insufficient detail. Reviewer 4 focused more on the simplicity of the text encoding, which restricts the novelty as more sophisticated text embeddings approaches are commonplace. <sep> Overall, the reviewers raised different concerns, and although all of them appreciated the need for this work and the revisions provided by the authors, ultimately feel that the paper did not quite meet the bar.
This paper presents a model for question answering, where the idea is to have a collaborative model that aligns queries and sentences on a small supervised dataset and also uses semi-supervised information from a weakly supervised corpus to answer open domain questions resulting in short answer spans. <sep> The main criticism of the paper is regarding its novelty, and reviewers cite the similarities with prior work such as Chen et al. and Min et al. There is relative consensus between the reviewers that further work using the semi-supervised outlook with stronger results could strengthen the paper further.
The reviewers agreed that there are some promising ideas in this work, and useful empirical analysis to motivate the approach. The main concern is in the soundness of the approach (for example, comments about cumulative learning and negative samples). The authors provided some justification about using previous networks as initialization, but this is an insufficient discussion to understand the soundness of the strategy. The paper should better discuss this more, even if it is not possible to provide theory. The paper could also be improved with the addition of a baseline (though not necessarily something like DeepStack, which is not publicly available and potentially onerous to reimplement).
Reviewer ratings varied radically (from a 3 to an 8). However, the reviewer rating the paper as 8 provided extremely little justification for their rating. The reviewers providing lower ratings gave more detailed reviews, and also engaged in discussion with the authors. Ultimately neither decided to champion the paper, and therefore, I cannot recommend acceptance.
there is a disagreement among the reviewers, and i am siding with the two reviewers (r1 and r3) and agree with r3 that it is rather unconventional to pick learning-to-learn to experiment with modelling variable-length sequences (it's not like there's no other task that has this characteristics, e.g., language modelling, translation, ...)
The paper proposes a novel approach to interfacing robots with humans, or rather vv: by mapping instructions to goals, and goals to robot actions. A possibly nice idea, and possibly good for more efficient learning. <sep> But the technical realisation is less strong than the initial idea. The original idea merits a good evaluation, and the authors are strongly encouraged to follow up on this idea and realise it, towards a stronger publication. <sep> It be noted that the authors refrained from using the rebuttal phase.
This paper presents an extensive empirical study to sentence-level pre-training. The paper compares pre-trained language models to other potential alternative pre-training options, and concludes that while pre-trained language models are generally stronger than other alternatives, the robustness and generality of the currently available method is less than ideal, at least with respect to ELMO-based pretraining. <sep> Pros: <sep> The paper presents an extensive empirical study that offers new insights on pre-trained language models with respect to a variety of sentence-level tasks. <sep> Cons: <sep> The primarily contributions of this paper is empirical and technical novelty is relatively weak. Also, the insights are based just on ELMO, which may have a relatively weak empirical impact. The reviews were generally positive but marginally positive, which reflect that insights are interesting but not overwhelmingly interesting. None of these is a deal-breaker per say, but the paper does not provide sufficiently strong novelty, whether based on insights or otherwise, relative to other papers being considered for acceptance. <sep> Verdict: <sep> Leaning toward reject due to relatively weak novelty and empirical impact. <sep> Additional note on the final decision: <sep> The insights provided by the paper are valuable, thus the paper was originally recommended for an accept. However, during the calibration process across all areas, it became evident that we cannot accept all valuable papers, each presenting different types of hard work and novel contributions. Consequently, some papers with mostly positive (but marginally positive) reviews could not be included in the final cut, despite their unique values, hard work, and novel contributions.
The paper proposes an approach to remedying mode collapse problem in GANs. This approach relies on using multiple discriminators and assigning a different portion of each minibatch to each discriminator. <sep> + preventing mode collapse in GAN training is an important problem <sep> - the exact motivation for the proposed techniques is not fully fleshed out <sep> - the evaluation and baselines used are lacking
The authors propose using a SVM, trained as a last layer of a neural network, to identify exemplars (support vectors) to save and use to prevent forgetting as the model is trained on further tasks. The method is effective on several supervised benchmarks and is compared to several other methods, including VCL, iCARL, and GEM. The reviewers had various objections to the initial paper that centered around comparisons to other methods and reporting of detailed performance numbers, which the authors resolved convincingly in their revised paper. However, the AC and 2 of the reviewers were unconvinced of the contribution of the approach. Although no one has used this particular strategy, of using support vectors to prevent forgetting, the approach is a simplistic composition of the NN and the SVM which is heuristic, at least in how the authors present it. Most importantly, the approach is limited to supervised classification problems, yet catastrophic forgetting is not commonly considered to be a problem for the supervised classifier setting; rather it is a problem for inherently sequential learning environments such as RL (MNIST and CIFAR are just commonly used in the literature for ease of evaluation).
The paper studies the problem of reinforcement learning under certain constraints on action sequences. The reviewers raised important concerns regarding (1) the general motivation, (2) the particular formulation of constraints in terms of action sequences and (3) the relevance and significance of experimental results. The authors did not submit a rebuttal. Given the concerns raised by the reviewers, I encourage the authors to improve the paper to possibly resubmit to another venue.
The method under consideration uses parallel convolutional filter groups per layer, where activations are averaged between the groups, forming "inner ensembles". <sep> Reviewers raised a number of concerns, including the increased computational cost for apparently little performance gain, the choice of base architecture (later addressed with additional experiments using WideResNet and ResNeXt), issues of clarity of presentation (some of which were addressed). One reviewer was unconvinced without direct comparison to full ensembles. Another reviewer raised the issue of a missing direct comparison to the most similar method in the literature, maxout (Goodfellow et al, 2013). Authors rebutted this by claiming that maxout is difficult to implement and offering vague arguments for its inferiority to their method. <sep> The AC agrees that a maxout baseline is important here, as it is extremely close to the proposed method and also trivially implemented, and that in light of maxout (and other related methods) the degree of novelty is limited. The AC also concurs that a full ensemble baseline would strengthen the paper's claims. In the absence of either of these the AC concurs with the reviewers that this work is not suitable for publication at this time.
The authors propose a scheme to learn a mapping between the discrete space of network architectures into a continuous embedding, and from the continuous embedding back into the space of network architectures. During the training phase, the models regress the number of parameters, and expected accuracy given the continuous embedding. Once trained, the model can be used for compression by first embedding the network structure and then performing gradient descent to maximize accuracy by minimizing the number of parameters. The optimized representation can then be mapped back into the discrete architecture space. <sep> Overall, the main idea of this work is very interesting, and the experiments show that the method has some promise. However, as was noted by the reviewers, the paper could be significantly strengthened by performing additional experiments and analyses. As such, the AC agrees with the reviewers that the paper in its present form is not suitable for acceptance, but the authors are encouraged to revise and resubmit this work to a future venue.
I appreciate the willingness of the authors to engage in vigorous discussion about their paper. Although several reviewers support accepting this submission, I do not find their arguments for acceptance convincing. The paper considers automated methods for finding errors in text classification models. I believe it is valuable to study the errors our models make in order to understand when they work well and how to improve them. Crucially, in the later case, we should demonstrate how to use the errors we find to close the loop and create better models. <sep> A paper about techniques to find errors for text models should make a sufficiently large contribution to be accepted. I view the following hypothetical contributions as the most salient in this specific case thus my decision reduces to determining if any of these conditions have been met. A paper need not achieve all of these things, any one of them would suffice: <sep> 1. Show that the errors found can be used to meaningfully improve the models. <sep> This requires building a better model than the one probed by the method and convincingly demonstrating that it is superior in an important way that is relevant to the original goals of the application. Ideally it would also consider alternative, simpler ways to improve the models (e.g. making them larger). <sep> 2. Show that errors are difficult to find, but that the proposed method is nonetheless capable of finding errors and that the method is non-obvious to a researcher in the field. <sep> This is not applicable here because errors are extremely easy to find on the test set and from labeling more data. If we demand an automated method, then the greedy algorithm does not qualify as sufficiently non-obvious and it seems to work fine, making the Gumbel method unnecessary. <sep> 3. Show that the particular specific errors found are qualitatively different from other errors in their implications and that they provide a unique and important insight. <sep> I do not believe this submission attempts to show this type of contribution. One example of this type of paper would be a paper that does a comparative study of the errors that different models make and finds something interesting (potentially yielding a path to improved models). <sep> 4. Generate a new, more difficult/interesting, dataset by finding errors of one or more trained models <sep> Given that the authors use human labelers to validate examples this is potentially another path. Here is an example of a paper using adversarial techniques in this way: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05326 <sep> However, I believe the paper would need to be rethought and rewritten to make this sort of contribution. <sep> Ultimately, the authors and reviews supporting acceptance must explain the contribution succinctly and convincingly. The reviewers most strongly advocating for accepting this submission seem to be saying that there is a valuable new method and probabilistic framework proposed here for finding model errors. I believe researchers in the field could have easily come up with the greedy algorithm (a standard approach to discrete optimization problems) proposed here without needing to read the paper. Furthermore, I believe the other more complicated Gumbel algorithm proposed is not necessary given the similarly effective and simpler greedy algorithm. If the authors believe that the Gumbel algorithm provides application-relevant advantages over the greedy algorithm, then they should specify how these errors will be used and rewrite the paper to make the greedy algorithm a baseline. However, I do not believe the experimental results support this idea.
This paper present a framework for creating meaning-preserving adversarial examples. It then proposes two attacks within this framework: one based on k-NN in the word embedding space, and another one based on character swapping. <sep> Overall, the goal of constructing such meaning-preserving attacks is very interesting. However, it is unclear how successful the proposed approach really is in the context of this goal. <sep> Additionally, it is not clear how much novelty there is compared to already existing methods that have a very similar aim.
Average score of 3.33, highest score of 4. <sep> The AC recommends rejection.
The paper proposes to take into accunt the label structure for classification <sep> tasks, instead of a flat N-way softmax. This also lead to a zero-shot setting <sep> to consider novel classes. Reviewers point to a lack of reference to prior <sep> work and comparisons. Authors have tried to justify their choices, but the <sep> overall sentiment is that it lacks novelty with respect to previous approaches. <sep> All reviewers recommend to reject, and so do I.
The authors propose a scheme to compress models using student-teacher distillation, where training data are augmented using examples generated from a conditional GAN. <sep> The reviewers were generally in agreement that 1) that the experimental results generally support the claims made by the authors, and 2) that the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. <sep> However, the reviewers also raised a number of concerns: 1) that the experiments were conducted on small-scale tasks, 2) the use of the compression score might be impractical since it would require retraining a compressed model, and is affected by the effectiveness of the compression algorithm which is an additional confounding factor. The authors in their rebuttal address 2) by noting that the student training was not too expensive, but I believe that this cost is task specific. Overall, I think 1) is a significant concern, and the AC agrees with the reviewers that an evaluation of the techniques on large-scale datasets would strengthen the paper.
This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to hierarchical text classification. <sep> Pros: A potentially interesting idea to drive the search process over a hierachical set of labels using reinforcement learning. <sep> Cons: The major concensus among all reviewers was that there were various concerns about experimental results, e.g., apple-to-apple comparisons against prior art (R1), proper tuning of hyper-parameters (R1, R2), the label space is too small (539) to have practical significance compared to tens of thousands of labels that have been used in other related work (R3), and other missing baselines (R3). In addition, even after the rebuttal, some of the technical clarity issues have not been fully resolved, e.g., what the proposed method is actually doing (optimizing F1 metric vs the ability to fix inconsistent labeling problem). <sep> Verdict: <sep> Reject. While authors came back with many detailed responses, they were not enough to address the major concerns reviewers had about the empirical significance of this work.
The paper proposes a new graph-based regularizer to improve the robustness of deep nets. The idea is to encourage smoothness on a graph built on the features at different layers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the method provides robustness over very different types of perturbations such as adversarial examples or quantization. The reviewers raised concerns around the significance of the results, the reliance on a single dataset and the unexplained link between adversarial examples and the regularization. Despite the revision, the reviewers maintain their concerns. For this reason this work is not ready for publication.
This paper seeks to shed light on why seq2seq models favor generic replies. The problem is an important one, unfortunately the responses proposed in the paper are not satisfactory. Most reviewers note problems and general lack of rigorousness in the assumptions used to produce the theoretical part of the paper (e.g., strong assumption of independence of generated words). The experiments themselves are not convincing enough to warrant acceptance by themselves.
Unfortunately, this paper fell just below the bar for acceptance. The reviewers all saw significant promise in this work, stating that it is intriguing, "novel and provides an interesting solution to a challenging problem" and that "many interesting use cases are clear". AnonReviewer2 particularly argued for acceptance, arguing that the proposed approach provides a very flexible method for incorporating constraints in neural network training. A concern of AnonReviewer2 was that there was no guarantee that this loss would be convex or converge to an optimum while statisfying the constraints. The other two reviewers unfortunately felt that while the proposed approach was "interesting", "promising" and "intriguing", the quality of the paper, in terms of exposition, was too low to justify acceptance. Arguably, it seems the writing doesn't do the idea justice in this case and the paper would ultimately be significantly more impactful if it was carefully rewritten.
The reviewers agree the paper is not ready for publication.
It is a simple but good idea to consider the choice of mini-batch size as a multi-armed bandit problem. Experiments also show a slight improvement compared to the best fixed batch size. <sep> The main concerns from the reviewers are that (1) treating the choice of hyper-parameters as a bandit problem is known and has been exploited in different context, and this paper is limited to the choice of the mini-batch size, (2) the improvement in the test error is not significant. The authors' feedback did not solve the concerns raised by R2. <sep> This paper conveys a nice idea but as the current form it falls slightly below the standard of the *CONF* publications. One direction for improvement, as suggested by the reviewer, would be extending the idea for a wider hyper-parameter selection problems.
This paper extends the DiCE estimator with a better control variate baseline for variance reduction. <sep> The reviewers all think the paper is fairly clear and well written. However, as the reviews and discussion indicates, there are several critical issues, including lack of explanation of the choice of baseline, the lack more realistic experiments and a few misleading assertions. We encourage the authors to rewrite the paper to address these criticism. We believe this work will make a successful submission with proper modification in the future.
-pros: <sep> - good, sensible idea <sep> - good evaluations on the domains considered <sep> - good analysis <sep> -cons: <sep> - novelty, broader evaluation <sep> I think this is a good and interesting paper and I appreciate the authors' engagment with the reviewers. I agree with the authors that it is not fair to compare their work to a blog post which hasn't been published and I have taken this into account. However, there is still concern among the reviewers about the strength of the technical contribution and the decision was made not to accept for *CONF* this year.
This paper was reviewed by three experts. Initially, the reviews were mixed with several concerns raised. After the author response, there continue to be concerns about need for significantly more experiments. If this were a journal, it is clear that recommendation would be "major revision". Since that option is not available and the paper clearly needs another round of reviews, we must unfortunately reject. We encourage the authors to incorporate reviewer feedback and submit a stronger manuscript at a future venue.
I appreciate that the authors are refuting a technical claim in Poole et al., however the paper has garnered zero enthusiasm the way it is written. I suggest to the authors that they rewrite the paper as a refutation of Poole et al., and name it as such.
This paper studies the role of pooling in the success underpinning CNNs. Through several experiments, the authors conclude that pooling is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve deformation stability, and that its inductive bias can be mostly recovered after training. <sep> All reviewers agreed that this is a paper asking an important question, and that it is well-written and reproducible. On the other hand, they also agreed that, in its current form, this paper lacks a 'punchline' that can drive further research. In words of R6, "the paper does not discuss the links between pooling and aliasing", or in words of R4, "it seems to very readily jump to unwarranted conclusions". In summary, the AC recommends rejection at this time, and encourages the authors to pursue the line of attack by exploring the suggestions of the reviewers and resubmit.
This paper proposes a VAE-based model which is able to perform musical timbre transfer. <sep> The reviewers generally find the approach well-motivated. The idea to perform many-to-many transfer within a single architecture is found to be promising. However, there have been some unaddressed concerns, as detailed below. <sep> R3 has some methodological concerns regarding negative transfer and asks for more extended experimental section. R1 and R2 ask for more interpretable results and, ultimately, a more conclusive study. R2 specifically finds the results to be insufficient. <sep> The authors have agreed with some of the reviewers' feedback but have left most of it unaddressed in a new revision. That could be because some of the recommendations require significant extra work. <sep> Given the above, it seems that this paper needs more work before being accepted in *CONF*.
The paper received mixed ratings. The proposed idea is quite reasonable but also sounds somewhat incremental. While the idea of separating foreground/background is reasonable, it also limits the applicability of the proposed method (i.e., the method is only demonstrated on aligned face images). In addition, combining AdaIn with foreground mask is a reasonable idea but doesn't sound groundbreakingly novel. The comparison against StarGAN looks quite anecdotal and the proposed method seems to cause only hairstyle changes (but transfer with other attributes are not obvious). In addition, please refer to detailed reviewers' comments for other concerns. Overall, it sounds like a good engineering paper that might be better fit to computer vision venue, but experimental validation seems somewhat preliminary and it's unclear how much novel insight and general technical contributions that this work provides.
The authors propose a GAN-based anomaly detection method based on simulating anomalies (low density regions of the data space) in order to train an anomaly classifier. <sep> While the paper addresses an interesting take on an important problem, there are many concerns raised by reviewers including novelty, clarity, attribution, reproducibility, the use of exclusively proprietary data, and a multitude of textual mistakes. Overall, the paper shows promise but does not seem to be a mature and polished piece of work. As there has been no rebuttal or update to the paper I have no choice but to concur with the reviewers' initial assessments and reject.
The reviewers find the per difficult to read. Reviewers also had concerns regarding the correctness of various claims in the paper. The paper was also found lacking in experimental analysis, as it only tested on relatively small datasets, and only no a CNN architecture. Overall, the paper appears to be lacking in quality and clarity, and questionable in correctness and originality.
This paper provides further insight into using RL for active learning, particularly by formulating AL as an MDP and then using RL methods for that MDP. Though the paper has a few insights, it does not sufficiently place itself amongst the many other similar strategies using an MDP formulation. I recommend better highlighting what is novel in this work (e.g., more focus on the reward function, if that is key). Additionally, avoid general statements like "To this end, we formalize the annotation process as a Markov decision process", which suggests that this is part of the contribution, but as highlighted by reviewers, has been a standard approach.
The paper conveys interesting idea but need more work in terms of fair empirical study and also improvement of the writing. The AC based her summary only on the technical argumentation presented by reviewers and authors.
The authors propose a framework for compressing neural network models which involves applying a weight distortion function periodically as part of training. The proposed approach is relatively simple to implement, and is shown to work for weight pruning, low-rank compression and quantization, without sacrificing accuracy. <sep> However, the reviewers had a number of concerns about the work. Broadly, the reviewers felt that the work was incremental. Further, if the proposed techniques are important to get the approach to work well in practice, then the paper would be significantly strengthened by further analyses. Finally, the reviewers noted that the paper does not consider whether the specific weight pruning strategies result in a reduction of computational resources beyond potential storage savings, which would be important if this method is to be used in practice. <sep> Overall, the AC tends to agree with the reviewers criticisms. The authors are encouraged to address some of these issues in future revisions of the work.
This paper presents a new defense against adversarial examples using random permutations and a Fourier transform. The technique is clearly novel, and the paper is clearly written. <sep> However, as the reviewers and commenters pointed out, there is a significant degradation in natural accuracy, which does not seem to be easily recoverable. This degradation is due to the random permutation of the images, which effectively disallows the use of convolutions. <sep> Furthermore, Reviewer 1 points out that the baselines are insufficient, as the authors do not explore (a) learning the transformation, or (b) using expectation over transformation to attack the model. <sep> This concern is further validated by the fact that Black-box attacks are often the best-performing, which is a sign of gradient masking. The authors try to address this by performing an attack against an ensemble of models, and against a substitute model attack. However, attacking an ensemble is not equivalent to optimizing the expectation, which would require sampling a new permutation at each step. <sep> The paper thus requires significantly stronger baselines and attacks.
The authors have presented an empirical study of generalization and regularization in DQN. They evaluate generalization on different variants of Atari games and show that dropout and L2 regularization are beneficial. The paper does not contain any major revelations, nor does it propose new algorithms or approaches, but it is a well-written and clear demonstration, and it would be interesting to the deep RL community. However, the reviewers did not feel that the paper met the bar for publication at *CONF* because the experiments were not more comprehensive, which would be expected for an empirical study. The AC will side with the reviewers but hopes that the authors will expand their study and resubmit to another venue in the future.
This paper proposes a faster approximation to batch norm, which avoids summing over the entire batch by subsampling either random examples or random image locations. It analyzes some of the tradeoffs of computation time vs. statistical efficiency of gradient estimation, and proposes schemes for decorrelating the samples to make good use of smaller numbers of samples. <sep> The proposal is a reasonable one, and seems to give a noticeable improvement in efficiency. However, it's not clear there is a substantial enough contribution for an *CONF* paper. The idea of subsampling is fairly obvious, and various other methods have already been proposed which decouple the computation of BN statistics from the training batch. From a practical standpoint, it's not clear that the observed benefit is large enough to justify the considerable complexity of an efficient implementation.
The authors present an interesting approach for combining finite state automata to compose new policies using temporal logic. The reviewers found this contribution interesting but had several questions that suggests that the current paper presentation could be significantly clarified and situated with respect to other literature. Given the strong pool of papers, this paper was borderline and the authors are encouraged to revise their paper to address the reviewers' feedback.
The paper provides an interesting combination of existing techniques (such as GCN and and the Bernoulli-Poisson link) to address the problem of overlapping community detection. However, there were concerns about lack of novelty, evaluation metrics, and missing comparisons with previous work. The authors did not provide a response to address these concerns.
The reviewers appreciated the clarity of writing, and the importance of the problem being addressed. There was a moderate amount of discussion around the paper, but the two reviewers who responded to the author discussion were split in their opinion, with one slightly increasing their score to a 6, and the other remaining unconvinced. The scores overall are borderline for *CONF* acceptance, and given that, no reviewer stepped forward to champion the paper.
This paper heavily modifies standard time-series-VAE models to improve their representation learning abilities. However, the resulting model seems like an ad-hoc combination of tricks that lose most of the nice properties of VAEs. The resulting method does not appear to be useful enough to justify itself, and it's not clear that the same ends couldn't be pursued using simpler, more general, and computationally cheaper approaches.
`This paper tackles the problem of learning with one hidden layer non-overlapping conv net for XOR detection problem. For this problem the paper shows that over parametrized models perform better, giving insights into why larger neural networks generalize better - an interesting question to study. However reviews opined that the setting considered in this paper is too specific to this XOR problem and the simplified network architecture, and the techniques are not generalizable to other models. Generalizing these results to more complex architectures or other learning problems will make the paper more interesting.
The reviewers raised a number of concerns including the usefulness of the presented dataset given that the collected data is acted rather than naturalistic (and the large body of research in affective computing explains that models trained on acted data cannot generalise to naturalistic data), no methodological novelty in the presented work, and relatively uninteresting application with very limited real-world application (it remains unclear whether having better empathetic dialogues would be truly crucial for any real-life application and, in addition, all work is based on acted rather than real-world data). The authors' rebuttal addressed some of the reviewers' concerns but not fully (especially when it comes to usefulness of the data). Overall, I believe that the effort to collect the presented database is noble and may be useful to the community to a small extent. However, given the unrealism of the data and, in turn, very limited (if any) generalisability of the presented to real-world scenarios, and lack of methodological contribution, I cannot recommend this paper for presentation at *CONF*.
The submission proposes a hierarchical clustering approach (nested-means clustering) to determine good quantization intervals for non-uniform quantization. An empirical validation shows improvement over a very closely related approach (Zhu et al, 2016). <sep> There was an overall consensus that the literature review was insufficient in its initial form. The authors have proposed to extend it somewhat. Other concerns are related to the novelty of the technique (R4 was particularly concerned about novelty over Zhu et al, 2016). <sep> Two reviewers were against acceptance, and one was positive about the paper. Due to the overall concerns about the novelty of the approach, and that these concerns were confirmed in discussion after the rebuttal, this paper is unlikely to meet the threshold for acceptance to *CONF*.
This work presents a reconstruction GAN with an additional classification task in the objective loss function. Evaluations are carried out on medical and non-medical datasets. <sep> Reviewers raise multiple concerns around the following: <sep> - Novelty (all reviewers) <sep> - Inadequate comparison baselines (all reviewers) <sep> - Inadequate citations. (R2 & R3) <sep> Authors have not offered a rebuttal. Recommendation is reject. Work may be more suitable as an application paper for a medical conference or journal.
It seems that the reviewers reached a consensus that the paper is not ready for publication in *CONF*. (see more details in the reviews below. )
This paper is extending the meta-learning MAML method to the mixture case. Specifically, the global parameters of the method are now modeled as a mixture. The authors also derive the elaborate associated inference for this approach. <sep> The paper is well written although Rev2 raises some presentation issues that can surely improve the quality of the paper, if addressed in depth. <sep> The results do not convince any of the three reviewers. Rev3 asks for a clearer exposition of the results to increase convincingness. Rev2 and Rev1 also make similar comments. <sep> Rev1 also questions the motivation of the approach, although the other two reviewers seem to find the approach well motivated. Although it certainly helps to prove the motivation within a very tailored to the method application, the AC weighted the opinion of all reviewers and did not consider the paper to lack in the motivation aspect. <sep> The reviewers were overall not very impressed with this paper and that does not seem to stem from lack of novelty or technical correctness. Instead, it seems that this work is rather inconclusive (or at least it is presented in an inconclusive manner): Rev1 says that the important questions (like trade-offs and other practical issues) are not answered, Rev2 suggests that maybe this paper is trying to address too much, and all three reviewers are not convinced by the experiments and derived insights. <sep> Finally, Rev2 points out some inherent caveats of the method; although they do not seem to be severe enough to undermine the overall quality of the approach, it would be instructive to have them investigated more thoroughly (even if not completely solving them).
The reviewers found that paper is well written, clear and that the authors did a good job placing the work in the relevant literature. The proposed method for using multiple discriminators in a multi-objective setting to train GANs seems interesting and compelling. However, all the reviewers found the paper to be on the borderline. The main concern was the significance of the work in the context of existing literature. Specifically, the reviewers did not find the experimental results significant enough to be convinced that this work presents a major advance in GAN training.
Reviewers are in a consensus and recommended to reject after engaging with the authors. Please take reviewers' comments into consideration to improve your submission should you decide to resubmit.
Following the unanimous vote of the submitted reviews, this paper is not ready for publication at *CONF*. Among other concerns raised, the experiments need significant work, and the exposition needs clarification.
This was a borderline paper and a very difficult decision to make. <sep> The paper addresses a potentially interesting problem in approximate POMDP planning, based on simplifying assumptions that perception can be decoupled from action and that a set of sensors exhibits certain conditional independence structure. As a result, a simple approach can be devised that incorporates a simple greedy perception method within a point-based value iteration scheme. <sep> Unfortunately, the assumptions the paper makes are so strong and seemingly artificial to the extent that they appear reverse engineered to the use of a simple perception heuristic. In principle, such a simplification might not be a problem if the resulting formulation captured practically important scenarios, but that was not convincingly achieved in this paper---indeed, another major limitation of the paper is its weak motivation. In more detail, the proposed approach relies on decoupling of perception and action, which is a restrictive assumption that bypasses the core issue of exploration versus exploitation in POMDPS. As model of active perception, the proposal is simplistic and somewhat artificial; the motivation for the particular cost model (cardinality of the sensor set) is particularly weak---a point that was not convincingly defended in the discussion. Perhaps the biggest underlying weakness is the experimental evaluation, which is inadequate to support a claim that the proposed methods show meaningful advantages over state-of-the-art approaches in important scenarios. A reviewer also raised legitimate questions about the strength of the theoretical analysis. <sep> In the end, the reviewers did not disagree on any substantive technical matter, but nevertheless did disagree in their assessments of the significance of the contribution. This is clearly a borderline paper, which on the positive side, was competently executed, but on the negative side, is pursuing an artificial scenario that enables a particularly simple algorithmic approach. <sep> Despite the lack of consensus, a difficult decision has to be made nonetheless. In the end, my judgement is that the paper is not yet strong enough for publication. I would recommend the authors significantly strengthen the experimental evaluation to cover off at least two of the major shortcomings of the current paper: (1) The true utility of the proposed method needs to be better established against stronger baselines in more realistic scenarios. (2) The relevance of the restrictive assumptions needs to be more convincingly established by providing concrete, realistic and more challenging case studies where the proposed techniques are still applicable. The paper would also be improved if the theoretical analysis could be strengthened to better address the criticisms of Reviewer 4.
* Strengths <sep> The paper proposes a novel and interesting method for detecting adversarial examples, which has the advantage of being based on general "fingerprint statistics" of a model and is not restricted to any specific threat model (in contrast to much of the work in the area which is restricted to adversarial examples in some L_p norm ball). The writing is clear and the experiments are extensive. <sep> * Weaknesses <sep> The experiments are thorough. However, they contain a subtle but important flaw. During discussion it was revealed that the attacks used to evaluate the method fail to reduce accuracy even at large values of epsilon where there are simple adversarial attacks that should reduce the accuracy to zero. This casts doubt on whether the attacks at small values of epsilon really are providing a good measure of the method's robustness. <sep> * Discussion <sep> There was substantial disagreement about the paper, with R1 feeling that the evaluation issues were serious enough to merit rejection and R3 feeling that they were not a large issue. In discussion with me, both R1 and R3 agreed that if an attack were demonstrated to break the method, that would be grounds for rejection. They also both agreed that there probably is an attack that breaks the method. A potential key difference is that R3 thinks this might be quite difficult to find and so merits publishing the paper to motivate stronger attacks. <sep> I ultimately agree with R1 that the evaluation issues are indeed serious. One reason for this is that there is by now a long record of adversarial defense papers posting impressive numbers that are often invalidated within a short period (often less than a month or so) of the paper being published. The "Obfuscated Gradients" paper of Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner suggests several basic sanity checks to help avoid this. One of the sanity checks (which the present paper fails) is to test that attacks work when epsilon is large. This is not an arbitrary test but gets at a key issue---any given attack provides only an *upper bound* on the worst-case accuracy of a method. For instance, if an attack only brings the accuracy of a method down to 80% at epsilon=1 (when we know the true accuracy should be 0%), then at epsilon=0.01 we know that the measured accuracy of the attack comes 80% from the over-optimistic accuracy at epsilon=1 and at most 20% from the true accuracy at epsilon=0.01. If the measured accuracy at epsilon=1 is close to 100%, then accuracy at lower values of epsilon provides basically no information. This means that the experiments as currently performed give no information about the true accuracy of the method, which is a serious issue that the authors should address before the paper can be accepted.
The reviewers agree that providing more insights on why batch normalization work is an important topic of investigation, but they all raised several problems with the current submission which need to be addressed before publication. The AC thus proposes "revise and sesubmit".
The submission proposes a setting of two agents, one of them probing the other (the latter being the "demonstrator"). The probing is done in a way that learns to imitate the expert's behavior, with some curiosity-driven reward that maximizes the chance that the probing agents has the expert do trajectories that the probing agent hasn't seen before. <sep> All the reviewers found the idea and experiments interesting. The major concern is whether the setup and the environments are too contrived. At least 2 reviewers commented on the fact that the environments/dataset seemed engineered for success of the given method, which is a concern about how this method would generalize to something other than the proposed setup. <sep> I also share the concern with R3 regarding the practicality of the proposed method: it is not obvious to me what problems this would actually be *useful* for, given that the method requires online interaction with an expert agent in order to succeed. The space of such scenarios where we can continuously probe an expert agent many many times for free/cheap is very small and frankly I'm not entirely sure why you would need to do imitation learning in that case at all (if the method was shown to work using only a state, rather than requiring a state/action pair from the expert, then maybe it'd be more useful). <sep> It's a tough call, but despite the nice results and interesting ideas, I think the method lacks generality and practical utility/significance and thus at this point I cannot recommend acceptance in its current form.
The paper presents an action conditioned video prediction method that combines previous losses in the literature, such as, perceptual, adversarial and infogan type of losses. The reviewers point out the lack of novelty in the formulation, as well as the lack of experiments that would verify its usefulness in model based RL. There is no rebuttal thus no ground for discussion or acceptance.
The paper studies how to construct infinitely deep infinite-width networks from a theoretical point of view, and uses the results of its theoretical analysis to design a weight initialization scheme for finite-width networks. While the idea is interesting and the paper may contain novel theoretical contributions, the experimental results are weak, as pointed out by all three reviewers from several different perspectives. In particular, it seems that the presented theoretical analysis is useful mainly for weight initialization and hence has limited potential impacts. In addition, the authors have responded to neither the AC's question, nor a detailed anonymous comment that challenges the value of Proposition 1 given the previous work by Aronszajn.
The paper proposes a quantity to monitor learning on an information plane which is related to the information curves considered in the bottleneck analysis but is more reliable and easier to compute. <sep> The main concern with the paper is the lack of interpretation and elaboration of potential uses. A concern is raised that the proposed method abstracts away way too much detail, so that the shapes of the curves are to be expected and contain little useful information (see AnonReviewer2 comments). The authors agree to some of the main issues, as they pointed out in the discussion, although they maintain that the method could still contain useful information. <sep> The reviewers are not very convinced by this paper, with ratings either marginally above the acceptance threshold, marginally below the acceptance threshold, or strong reject.
The paper presents an architecture search method which jointly optimises the architecture and its weights. As noted by reviewers, the method is very close to Shirakawa et al., with the main innovation being the use of categorical distributions to model the architecture. This is a minor innovation, and while the results are promising, they are not strong enough to justify acceptance based on the results alone.
This paper addresses the problem of recommendations within user sessions from a reinforcement learning perspective. The problem is naturally modeled as an RL problem, given its sequential nature and inherent uncertainty of any model over user preferences. The problem suffers from delayed and sparse rewards, which the authors propose to address using self-supervised prediction. The approach is empirically validated in a simulated setting, using data from the 2015 ACM RecSys Challenge. <sep> The reviewers and AC note that the problem studied is an important application area where RL has high potential to improve over current research results and industry practice. The proposed idea is interesting, and the strong empirical evaluation on a publicly available data set is highlighted. R1 also commends the authors' decision to address the challenging cold-start problem. <sep> The reviewers and AC also note several potential weaknesses. The choice of addressing the problem from a reinforcement learning perspective is not clearly motivated. This is needed, as many supervised learning (and other types) approaches to the problem exist. A performance comparison to current state-of-the-art RL baselines is missing. The proposed approach is related to both imagination augmented (I2A, Racaniere et al. 2017) and agents with auxiliary rewards (UNREAL, Jaderberg et al. 2016), but does not compare to either method. Neither does the related work section sufficiently clarify why the proposed approach is expected to improve over these prior approaches. A thorough comparison to these baselines in a real-world application like session-based recommendation would be a strong contribution in itself, but without the contributions of the paper are hard to assess. Reviewers also noted lack of clarity. Some concerns are addressed by the authors, but the consensus is that the paper would benefit from a major revision to clearly work out the method, as well as it's conceptual and empirical differences from existing reinforcement learning approaches. R3 mentions missing related work, some of which the authors include in the revision. The AC recommends also following up on references in cited papers to ensure a future revision of the paper is well placed in the context of prior work on recommender systems, especially when modeled as a reinforcement learning problem. <sep> Overall, the paper was assessed as borderline by the reviewers. The ACs view is that there are too many concerns for acceptance at *CONF* in the present form, and that the paper will benefit from a thorough revision.
The paper introduces a form of variational auto encoder for learning disentangled representations. The idea is to penalise synergistic mutual information. The introduction of concepts from synergy to the community is appreciated. <sep> Although the approach appears interesting and forward looking in understanding complex models, at this point the paper does not convince on the theoretical nor on the experimental side. The main concepts used in the paper are developed elsewhere, the potential value of synergy is not properly examined. <sep> The reviewers agree on a not so positive view on this paper, with ratings either ok, but not good enough, or clear rejection. There is a consensus that the paper needs more work.
The reviewers are polarized on this paper and the overall feeling is that it is not quite ready for publication. There is also an interesting interpretability aspect that, while given as a motivation for the approach, is never really explored beyond showing some figures of alignments. One of the main concerns of the method's effectiveness in practice is the computational cost. There is also concern from one of the reviewers that the formulation could result in creating sparse matching maps where only a few pixels get matched. The authors provide some justification for why this wouldn't happen, and this should be put in a future draft. Even better would be to show statistics to demonstrate empirically that this doesn't happen. <sep> There were a number of clarifications that were brought up during the discussion, and the authors should go over this carefully and update the draft to resolve these issues. There is also a typo in the title that should be fixed.
The authors propose implementing intrinsic motivation as a differentiable supervised loss coming from the error of a forward model, rather than the black box style of curiosity reward. The motivation is that this approach will lead to more sample efficient exploration for real robots. The use of a differentiable loss for policy optimization is interesting and has some novelty. However, the reviewers were unanimous in their criticism of the paper for poor baselines, unclear experiments and results, and unsupported claims. Even after substantial revisions to the paper, the AC and reviewers were unconvinced of the basic claims of the paper.
This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation. TopicGAN operates in two steps: it first generates latent topics and produces bag-of-words corresponding to those latent topics. In the second step, the model generates text conditioning on those topic words. <sep> Pros: <sep> It combines the strength of topic models (interpretable topics that are learned unsupervised) with GAN for text generation. <sep> Cons: <sep> There are three major concerns raised by reviewers: (1) clarity, (2) relatively thin experimental results, and (3) novelty. Of these, the first two were the main concerns. In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (e.g., text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines. Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3). The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together. But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong. <sep> Verdict: <sep> Reject. Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.
This work proposes to use the MAML meta-learning approach in order to tackle the typical problem of insufficient demonstrations in IRL. <sep> All reviewers found this work to contain a novel and well-motivated idea and the manuscript to be well-written. The combination of MAML and MaxEnt IRL is straightforward, as R2 points out, however the AC does not consider this to be a flaw given that the main novelty here is the high-level idea rather than the technical details. <sep> However, all reviewers agree that for this paper to meet the *CONF* standards, there has to be an increase in rigorousness through (a) a more close examination of assumptions, sensitivity of parameters and connections to imitation learning (b) expanding the experimental section.
This is an interesting direction but multiple reviewers had concerns about the amount of novelty in the current work, and given the strong pool of other papers, this didn't quite reach the threshold.
The paper proposes adversarial sampling for pool-based active learning. <sep> The reviewers and AC note the critical potential weaknesses on experimental results: it is far from being surprising the proposed method is better than random sampling. Ideally, one has to reduce the complexity under keeping the state-of-art performance. Otherwise, it is hard to claim the proposed method is fundamentally better than prior ones, although their targets might be different. <sep> AC thinks the proposed method has potential and is interesting, but decided that the authors need more works to publish.
I enjoyed reading the paper myself and I appreciate the unifying framework connecting RAML and SPG. While I do not put a lot of weight on the experiments, I agree with the reviewers that the experimental results are not very strong, and I am not convinced that the theoretical contribution meets the bar at *CONF*. <sep> In the interpolation algorithm, there seems to be an additional annealing parameter and two tuning parameters. It is important to describe how the parameters are tuned. Given the additional hyper-parameters, one may consider giving all of the algorithms the same budget of hyper-parameter tuning. I also agree with reviewers that the policy gradient baseline seems to underperform typical results. One possible way to strengthen the experiments is to try to replicate the results of SPG or RAML and discuss the behavior of each algorithm as a function of hyper-parameters.
This paper does two things. First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X. Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training. The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay. The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong. In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that "[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?" is critical, and the authors' reply that "this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for "compactness" or "complexity" than the mutual information itself" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information. The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise. Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the *CONF* review process.
All reviewers agree in their assessment that this paper has merits but is not yet ready for acceptance into *CONF*. The area chair commends the authors for their responses to the reviews.
This paper presents a dataset for measuring disentanglement in learned representations. It consists of MNIST digits, sometimes transformed in various ways, and labeled with a variety of attributes. This dataset is used to measure statistics of various learned models. <sep> Measuring disentanglement is certainly an important problem in our field. This dataset seems to be well designed, and I would recommend its use for papers studying disentanglement. The experiments are well-designed. While the reviewers seem bothered by the fact that it's limited to MNIST, this doesn't strike me as a problem. We continue to learn a lot from MNIST, even today. <sep> But producing a useful dataset isn't by itself a significant enough research contribution for an *CONF* paper. I'd recommend publication if (a) it were very different from currently existing datasets, (b) constructing it required overcoming significant technical obstacles, or (c) the dataset led to particularly interesting findings. <sep> Regarding (a), there are already datasets of similar complexity which have ground-truth attributes useful for measuring disentanglement, such as dSprites and 3D Faces. Regarding (b), the construction seems technically straightforward. Regarding (c), the experimental findings are plausible and consistent with past findings (which is a good validation of the dataset) but not obviously interesting in their own right. <sep> So overall, this seems like a useful dataset, but I cannot recommend publication at *CONF*.
This paper studies the properties of L1 regularization for deep neural network. It contains some interesting results, e.g. the stationary point of an l1 regularized layer has bounded number of non-zero elements. On the other hand, the majority of reviewers has concerns on that experimental supports are weak and suggests rejection. Therefore, a final rejection is proposed.
The authors propose a technique for pruning networks by using second-order information through the Hessian. The Hessian is approximated using the Fisher Information Matrix, which is itself approximated using KFAC. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, and is evaluated on a number of systems where the authors find that the proposed method achieves good compression ratios without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. <sep> The reviewers raised concerns about 1) the novelty of the work (which builds on the KFAC work of Martens and Grosse), 2) whether zeroing out individual connections as opposed to neurons will have practical runtime benefits, 3) the lack of comparisons against baselines on overall training time/complexity, 4) comparisons to work which directly prune as part of training (instead of the train-prune-finetune scheme adopted by the authors). <sep> In the view of the AC, 4) would be an interesting comparison but was not critical to the decision. Ultimately, the decision came down to the concern of lack of novelty and whether the proposed techniques would have an impact on runtime in practice.
This paper tackles the problem of using auxiliary losses to help regularize and aid the learning of a "goal" task. The approach proposes avoiding the learning of irrelevant or contradictory details from the auxiliary task at the expense of the "goal" tasks by observing cosine similarity between the auxiliary and main tasks and ignore those gradients which are too dissimilar. <sep> To justify such a setup one must first show that such negative interference occurs in practice, warranting explicit attention. Then one must show that their algorithm effectively mitigates this interference and at the same time provides some useful signal in combination with the main learning objective. <sep> During the review process there was a significant discussion as to whether the proposed approach sufficiently justified its need and usefulness as defined above. One major point of contention is whether to compare against the multi-task literature. The authors claim that prior multi-task learning literature is out of scope of this work since their goal is not to measure performance on all tasks used during learning. However, this claim does not invalidate the reviewer's request for comparison against multi-task learning work. In fact, the authors *should* verify that their method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. Not because they too are studying performance across all tasks, but because their method which knows to prioritize one task during training should certainly outperform the learning paradigms which have no special preference to one of the tasks. <sep> A main issue with the current draft centers around the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. First, whether the gradient co-sine similarity is a necessary condition to avoid negative interference and 2) to show at least empirically that auxiliary losses do offer improved performance over optimizing the goal task alone. Based on the experiments now available the answers to these questions remains unclear and thus the paper is not yet recommended for publication.
The paper proposes a new method for training generative models by minimizing general f-divergences. The main technical idea is to optimize f-divergence between joint distributions which is rightly observed to be the upper bound of the f-divergence between the marginal distributions and address the disjoint support problem by convolving the data with a noise distribution. The basic ideas in this work are not completely novel but are put together in a new way. <sep> However, the key weakness of this work, as all the reviewer noticed, is that the empirical results are too week to support the usefulness of the proposed approach. The only quantitive results are in table 2, which is only a simple Gaussian example. It essential to have more substantial empirical results for supporting the new algorithm.
mnist and small picture variants are not that impressive. <sep> it is a minor extension of VAEs which also are not common in sota systems.
The paper contains useful information and shows relative improvements compared to mixup. However, some of the main claims are not substantiated enough to be fully convincing. For example, the claims that manifold mixup can prevent can manifold collision issue where the interpolation between two samples collides with a sample from other class is incorrect. The authors are encouraged to incorporate remarks of the reviewers.
This paper shows convergence of stochastic gradient descent for the problem of learning weight matrices for a linear dynamical system with non-linear activation. Reviewers agree that the problem considered is both interesting and challenging. However the paper makes many simplifying assumptions - 1) both input and hidden state are observed, a very non standard assumption, 2) analysis requires increasing activation functions, cannot handle ReLU functions. I agree with R2 and think these assumptions make the results significantly weaker. R1 and R3 are more optimistic, but authors response does not give an insight into how one might extend this analysis to the setting where hidden state is not observed. Relaxing these assumptions will make the paper more interesting.
The paper proposes two simple generator architecture variants enabling the use of GAN training for the tasks of denoising (from known noise types) and demixing (of two added sources). While the denoising approach is very similar to AmbientGAN and could thus be considered somewhat incremental, all reviewers and the AC agree that the developed use of GANs for demixing is an interesting novel direction. The paper is well written, and the approach is supported by encouraging experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. <sep> Reviewers and AC noted the following weaknesses of the paper: a) no theoretical support or analysis is provided for the approach, this makes it primarily an empirical study of a nice idea. <sep> b) For an empirical study, the experimental evaluation is very limited, both in terms of dataset/problems it is tested on; and in terms of algorithms for demixing/source-separation that it is compared against. <sep> Following these reviews, the authors added the experiments on Fashion-MNIST and comparison with ICA which are steps in the right direction. This improvement moved one reviewer to positively update his score, but not the others. <sep> Taking everything into account, the AC judges that it is a very promising direction, but that more extensive experiments on additional benchmark tasks for demixing and comparison with other demixing algorithms are needed to make this work a more complete contribution.
The paper tried to introduce a new interpretation of dropout and come with improved algorithms. However, the reviewers were not convinced that the presented arguments were correct/novel, and they found the paper difficult to follow. The authors are encouraged to carefully revise their paper to address these concerns.
This paper shows how to implement a low-rank version of the Adagrad preconditioner in a GPU-friendly manner. A theoretical analysis of a "hard-window" version of the proposed algorithm demonstrates that it is not worse than SGD at finding a first-order stationary point in the nonconvex setting. Experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using a ConvNet and Penn Treebank character-level language modeling using an LSTM show that the proposed algorithm improves training loss faster than SGD, Adagrad, and Adam (measuring time in epochs) and has better generalization performance on the language modeling task. However, if wall-clock time is used to measure time, there is no speedup for the ConvNet model, but there is for the recurrent model. The reviewers liked the simplicity of the approach and greatly appreciated the elegant visualization of the eigenspectrum in Figure 4. But, even after discussion, critical concerns remained about the need for more focus on the practical tradeoffs between per-iteration improvement and per-second improvement in the loss and the need for a more careful analysis of the relationship of this method to stochastic L-BFGS. A more minor concern is that the term "full-matrix regularization" seems somewhat deceptive when the actual regularization is low rank. The AC also suggests that, if the authors plan to revise this paper and submit it to another venue, they consider the relationship between GGT and the various stochastic natural gradient optimization algorithms in the literature that differ from GGT primarily in the exponent on the Gram matrix.
The work proposes a method for smoothing a non-differentiable machine learning pipeline (such as the Faster-RCNN detector) using policy gradient. Unfortunately, the reviewers identified a number of critical issues, including no significant improvement beyond existing works. The authors did not provide a rebuttal for these critical issues.
The authors propose a generative model based on variational autoencoders that provides means to manipulate the high-level attributes of a given input. The attributes can be either pre-defined ground truth attributes or unknown attributes automatically discovered from the data. <sep> While the reviewers acknowledged the potential usefulness of the proposed approach, they raised important concerns that were viewed by AC as a critical issue: (1) very limited experimental evaluation (e.g. no baseline or ablation results, no quantitative results); comparisons on other more complex datasets and more in-depth analysis would substantially strengthen the evaluation and would allow to assess the scope of the contribution of this work – see, for example, R3's suggestion to use other dataset like dSprites or CelebA, where the ground truth attributes are known; (2) lack of presentation clarity – see R2's latest comment how to improve. <sep> A general consensus among reviewers and AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication. It needs clarification, more empirical studies and polish to achieve the desired goal.
The manuscript proposes a novel estimation technique for generative models based on fast nearest neighbors and inspired by maximum likelihood estimation. Overall, reviewers and AC agree that the general problem statement is timely and interesting, and the subject is of interest to the *CONF* community <sep> The reviewers and ACs note weakness in the evaluation of the proposed method. In particular, reviewers note that the Parzen-based log-likelihood estimate is known to be unreliable in high-dimensions. This makes a quantitative evaluation of the results challenging, thus other metrics should be evaluated. Reviewers also expressed concerns about the strengths of the baselines compared. Additional concerns are raised with regards to scalability which the authors address in the rebuttal.
While the paper contains interesting ideas, the reviewers suggest improving the clarity and experimental study of the paper. The work holds promises but is not ready for publication at *CONF*.
This paper proposes a new method to mine sentence from Wikipedia and use them to train an MT system, and also a topic-based loss function. In particular, the first contribution, which is the main aspect of the proposal is effective, outperforming methods for fully unsupervised learning. <sep> The main concern with the proposed method, or at least it's description in the paper, is that it isn't framed appropriately with respect to previous work on mining parallel sentences from comparable corpora such as Wikipedia. Based on interaction in the reviews, I feel that things are now framed a bit better, and there are additional baselines, but still the explanation in the paper isn't framed with respect to this previous work, and also the baselines are not competitive, despite previous work reporting very nice results for these previous methods. <sep> I feel like this could be a very nice paper at some point if it's re-written with the appropriate references to previous work, and experimental results where the baselines are done appropriately. Thus at this time I'm not recommending that the paper be accepted, but encourage the authors to re-submit a revised version in the future.
The paper proposed an operation called StructPool for graph-pooling by treating it as node clustering problem (assigning a label from 1..k to each node) and then use a pairwise CRF structure to jointly infer these labels. The reviewers all think that this is a well-written paper, and the experimental results are adequate to back up the claim that StructPool offers advantage over other graph-pooling operations. Even though the idea of the presented method is simple and it does add more (albeit by a constant factor) to the computational burden of graph neural network, I think this would make a valuable addition to the literature.
Most reviewers seems in favour of accepting this paper, with the borderline rejection being satisfied with acceptance if the authors take special heed of their comments to improve the clarity of the paper when preparing the final version. From examination of the reviews, the paper achieves enough to warrant publication. Accept.
This paper presents a case study of training a video classifier and subsequently analyzing the features to reduce reliance on spurious artifacts. The supervised learning task is zebrafish bout classification which is relevant for biological experiments. The paper analyzed the image support for the learned neural net features using a previously developed technique called Deep Taylor Decomposition. This analysis showed that the CNNs when applied to the raw video were relying on artifacts of the data collection process, which spuriously increased classification accuracies by a "clever Hans" mechanism. By identifying and removing these artifacts, a retrained CNN classifier was able to outperform an older SVM classifier. More importantly, the analysis of the network features enabled the researchers to isolate which parts of the zebrafish motion were relevant for the classification. <sep> The reviewers found the paper to be well-written and the experiments to be well-designed. The reviewers suggested a some changes to the phrasing in the document, which the authors adopted. In response to the reviewers, the authors also clarified their use of ImageNet for pre-training and examined alternative approaches for building saliency maps. <sep> This paper should be published as the reviewers found the paper to be a good case study of how model interpretability can be useful in practice.
The authors provide an empirical and theoretical exploration of Nesterov momentum, particularly in the over-parametrized settings. Nesterov momentum has attracted great interest at various times in deep learning, but its properties and practical utility are not well understood. This paper makes an important step towards shedding some light on this approach for training models with a large number of parameters.
This paper provides a theoretical background for the expressive power of graph convolutional networks. The results are obviously useful, and the discussion went in the positive way. All reviewers recommend accepting, and I am with them.
The paper proposes a using pixel-adaptive convolutions to leverage semantic labels in self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Although there were initial concerns of the reviewers regarding the technical details and limited experiments, the authors responded reasonably to the issues raised by the reviewers. Reviewer2, who gave a weak reject rating, did not provide any answer to the authors comments. We do not see any major flaws to reject this paper.
This paper examines the correspondence between topological similarity of languages (correlation between the message space and object space) and ability to learn quickly in a situation of emergent communication between agents. <sep> While this paper is not without issues, it does seem to present a nice contribution that all of the reviewers appreciated to some extent. I think it will spark further discussions in this area, and thus can recommend it for acceptance.
The paper proposed a new pretrained language model which can take visual information into the embeddings. Experiments showed state-of-the-art results on three downstream tasks. The paper is well written and detailed comparisons with related work are given. There are some concerns about the clarity and novelty raised by the reviewers which is answered in details and I think the paper is acceptable.
The authors address the important and understudied problem of tuning of unsupervised models, in particular variational models for learning disentangled representations. They propose an unsupervised measure for model selection that correlates well with performance on multiple tasks. After significant fruitful discussion with the reviewers and resulting revisions, many reviewer concerns have been addressed. There are some remaining concerns that there may still be a gap in the theoretical basis for the application of the proposed measure to some models, that for different downstream tasks the best model selection criteria may vary, and that the method might be too cumbersome and not quite reliable enough for practitioners to use it broadly. All of that being said, the reviewers (and I) agree that the approach is sufficiently interesting, and the empirical results sufficiently convincing, to make the paper a good contribution and hopefully motivation for additional methods addressing this problem.
This works improves the MixMatch semi-supervised algorithm along the two directions of distribution alignment and augmentation anchoring, which together make the approach more data-efficient than prior work. <sep> All reviewers agree that the impressive empirical results in the paper are its main strength, but express concern that the method is overly complicated and hacking together many known pieces, as well as doubt as to the extent of the contribution of the augmentation method itself, with requests for better augmentation controls. <sep> While some of these concerns have not been addressed by authors in their response, the strength of empirical results seems enough to justify an acceptance recommendation.
The authors propose to enforce interpretability and controllability on latent variables, like affect and speaking rate, in a speech synthesis model by training in a semi-supervised way, with a small amount of labeled data with the variables of interest labeled. The idea is sensible and the results are very encouraging, and the authors have addressed the initial concerns brought up by the reviewers.
This paper introduces a way to augment memory in recurrent neural networks with order-independent aggregators. In noisy environments this results in an increase in training speed and stability. The reviewers considered this to be a strong paper with potential for impact, and were satisfied with the author response to their questions and concerns.
This paper proposes techniques to improve training with batch normalization. The paper establishes the benefits of these techniques experimentally using ablation studies. The reviewers found the results to be promising and of interest to the community. However, this paper is borderline due in part due to the writing (notation issues) and because it does not discuss related work enough. We encourage the authors to properly address these issues before the camera ready.
The submission proposes an approach to accelerate network training by modifying the precision of individual weights, allowing a substantial speed up without a decrease in model accuracy. The magnitude of the activations determines whether it will be computed at a high or low bitwidth. <sep> The reviewers agreed that the paper should be published given the strong results, though there were some salient concerns which the authors should address in their final revision, such as how the method could be implemented on GPU and what savings could be achieved. <sep> Recommendation is to accept.
Main content: <sep> Blind review #2 summarizes it well: <sep> Summary: This paper deals with the representation degeneration problem in neural language generation, as some prior works have found that the singular value distribution of the (input-output-tied) word embedding matrix decays quickly. The authors proposed an approach that directly penalizes deviations of the SV distribution from the two prior distributions, as well as a few other auxiliary losses on the orthogonality of U and V (which are now learnable). The experiments were conducted on small and large scale language modeling datasets as well as the relatively small IWSLT 2014 De-En MT dataset. <sep> Pros: <sep> + The paper is well-written with great clarity. The dimensionality of the involved matrices (and their decompositions) are clearly provided, and the approach is clearly described. The authors also did a great job providing the details of their experimental setup. <sep> + The experiments seem to show consistent improvements over the baseline methods (at least the ones listed by the authors) on a relatively extensive set of tasks (e.g., of both small and large scales, of two different NLP tasks). Via WT2 and WT103, the authors also showed that their method worked on both LSTM and Transformers (which it should, as the SVD on word embedding should be independent of the underlying architecture). <sep> + I think studying the expressivity of the output embedding matrix layer is a very interesting (and important) topic for NLP. (e.g., While models like BERT are widely used, the actual most frequently re-used module of BERT is its pre-trained word embeddings.) <sep> -- <sep> Discussion: <sep> The reviewers agree that it is a very well written paper, and this is important as a conference paper to illuminate readers. <sep> The one main objection is that spectrum control regularization was previously proposed and applied to GANs (Jiang et al *CONF* 2019). However the authors convincingly point out that the technique is widely used, not only for GANs, and that application to neural language generation has quite different characteristics requiring a different, new approach: "our proposed prior distributions as shown in Figure 2 in our paper are fundamentally different from the singular value distributions learned using their penalty functions (See Figure 1 and Table 7 in Jiang et al.'s paper). Figure 1 in their paper suggests that their penalty function, i.e., D-optimal Reg, will encourage all the singular values close to 1, which is well aligned with their motivation for training GAN. However, if we use such penalty function to train neural language models, the learned word representations will lose the power of modeling contextual information, and can result in much worse results than the baseline methods." <sep> -- <sep> Recommendation and justification: <sep> I concur with the majority of reviewers that this paper is a weak accept. Though not revolutionary, it is well written, has usefully broad application, and is supported well empirically.
This paper proposes a bidirectional joint image-text model using a variational hetero-encoder (VHE) randomized generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed VHE-GAN model encodes an image to decode its associated text. Three reviewers have split reviews. Reviewer #3 is overall positive about this work. Reviewer #1 rated weak acceptance, while request more comparison with latest works. Reviewer #2 rated weak reject raised concerns on the motivation of the approach, the lack of ablation and lack of comparison with the latest work. During the rebuttal, the authors provide additional comparison and ablation, which seem to address the major concerns. Given the overall positive feedback and the quality of rebuttal, the AC recommends acceptance.
This paper applies reinforcement learning to text adventure games by using knowledge graphs to constrain the action space. This is an exciting problem with relatively little work performed on it. Reviews agree that this is an interesting paper, well written, with good results. There are some concerns about novelty but general agreement that the paper should be accepted. I therefore recommend acceptance.
This paper studies optimal control with low-dimensional representation. The paper presents interesting progress, although I urge the authors to address all issues raised by reviewers in their revisions.
This paper studies the role of topology in designing adversarial defenses. Specifically , the authors study defense strategies that rely on the assumption that data lies on a low-dimensional manifold, and show theoretical and empirical evidence that such defenses need to build a topological understanding of the data. <sep> Reviewers were initially positive, but had some concerns pertaining to clarity and limited experimental setup. After a productive rebuttal phase, now reviewers are mostly in favor of acceptance, thanks to the improved readibility and clarity. Despite the small-scale experimental validation, ultimately both reviewers and AC conclude this paper is worthy of publication.
The paper proposes to compress convolutional neural networks via weight sharing across filters of each convolution layer. A fast convolution algorithm is also designed for the convolution layer with this approach. Experimental results show (i) effectiveness in CNN compression, (ii) acceleration on the tasks of image classification, object detection and neural architecture search. While the authors addressed most of reviewers' concerns, the weakness of the paper which remains is that no wall-clock runtime numbers (only FLOPS) are reported - so efficiency of the approach in practice in uncertain.
Main description: paper focuses on training neural networks using 8-bit floating-point numbers (FP8). The goal is highly motivated: training neural networks faster, with smaller memory footprint and energy consumption. <sep> Discussions <sep> reviewer 3: gives a very short review and is not knowledagble in this area (rating is weak accept) <sep> reviewer 4: well written and convincing paper, some minor technical flaws (not very knowledgable) <sep> reviewer 1: interesting paper but argues not very practical (not very knowledgable) <sep> reviewer 2: this is the most thorough and knowledable review, and here the authors like the scope of the paper and its interest to *CONF*. <sep> Recommendation: going mainly by reviewer 2, i vote to accept this as a poster
Sleep" is introduced as a way of increasing robustness in neural network training. To sleep, the network is converted into a spiking network and goes through phases of more and less intense activation. The results are quite good when it comes to defending against adversarial examples. Reviewers agree that the method is novel and interesting. Authors responded to the reviewers' questions (one of the reviewers had a quite extensive set of questions) satisfactorily, and improved the paper significantly in the process. I think the paper should be accepted on the grounds of novelty and good results.
This is an interesting contribution that sheds some light on a well-studied but still poorly understood problem. I think it might be of interest to the community.
This paper studies the question of why a network trained to reproduce a single image often de-noises the image early in training. This an interesting question and, post discussion, all three reviewers agree that it will be of general interest to the community and is worth publishing. Therefore I recommend it be accepted.
The authors propose to learn space-aware 3D feature abstractions of the world given 2.5D input, by minimizing 3D and 2D view contrastive prediction objectives. The work builds upon Tung et al. (2019) but extends it by removing some of the limitations, making it thus more general. To do so, they learn an inverse graphics network which takes as input 2.5D video and maps to a 3D feature maps of the scene. The authors present experiments on both real and simulation datasets and their proposed approach is tested on feature learning, 3D moving object detection, and 3D motion estimation with good performance. All reviewers agree that this is an important problem in computer vision and the papers provides a working solution. The authors have done a good job with comparisons and make a clear case about their superiority of their model (large datasets, multiple tasks). Moreover, the rebuttal period has been quite productive, with the authors incorporating reviewers' comments in the manuscript, resulting thus in a stronger submission. Based in reviewer's comment and my own assessment, I think this paper should get accepted, as the experiments are solid with good results that the CV audience of *CONF* would find relevant.
This paper studies learning with noisy labels by integrating the idea of curriculum learning. <sep> All reviewers and AC are happy with novelty, clear write-up and experimental results. <sep> I recommend acceptance.
This paper presents a detailed comparison of different bonus-based exploration methods on a common evaluation framework (Rainbow) when used with the ATARI game suite. They find that while these bonuses help on Montezuma's Revenge (MR), they underperform relative to epsilon-greedy on other games. This suggests that architectural changes may be a more important factor than bonus-based exploration in recent advances on MR. <sep> The reviewers commented that this paper makes no effort to present new techniques, and the insights discovered could be expanded on. Despite this, it is an interesting paper that is generally well argued and would be a useful contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance.
Four reviewers have assessed this paper and they have scored it as 6/6/6/6 after rebuttal. Nonetheless, the reviewers have raised a number of criticisms and the authors are encouraged to resolve them for the camera-ready submission. Especially, the authors should take care to make this paper accessible (understandable) to the ML community as *CONF* is a ML venue (rather than quantum physics one). Failure to do so will likely discourage the generosity of reviewers toward this type of submissions in the future.
Main content: Paper proposes a fast network adaptation (FNA) method, which takes a pre-trained image classification network, and produces a network for the task of object detection/semantic segmentation <sep> Summary of discussion: <sep> reviewer1: interesting paper with good results, specifically without the need to do pre-training on Imagenet. Cons are better comparisons to existing methods and run on more datasets. <sep> reviewer2: interesting idea on adapting source network network via parameter re-mapping that offers good results in both performance and training time. <sep> reviewer3: novel method overall, though some concerns on the concrete parameter remapping scheme. Results are impressive <sep> Recommendation: Interesting idea and good results. Paper could be improved with better comparison to existing techniques. Overall recommend weak accept.
The paper proposes an algorithm for learning a transport cost function that accurately captures how two datasets are related by leveraging side information such as a subset of correctly labeled points. The reviewers believe that this is an interesting and novel idea. There were several questions and comments, which the authors adequately addressed. I recommend that the paper be accepted.
Congratulations on getting your paper accepted to *CONF*. Please make sure to incorporate the reviewers' suggestions for the final version.
Under the optimization formulation of adversarial attack, this paper proposes two methods to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, namely Nesterov Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (NI-FGSM) and Scale-Invariant attack Method (SIM). NI-FGSM adapts Nesterov accelerated gradient into the iterative attacks to effectively look ahead and avoid the "missing" of the global maximum, and SIM optimizes the adversarial perturbations over the scale copies of the input images so as to avoid "overfitting" on the white-box model being attacked and generate more transferable adversarial examples. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The ideas are sensible, and the empirical studies were strengthened during rebuttal.
The paper proposes a very simple but thoroughly evaluated and investigated idea for improving generalization in GCNs. Though the reviews are mixed, and in the post-rebuttal discussion the two negative reviewers stuck to their ratings, the area chair feels that there are no strong grounds for rejection in the negative reviews. Accept.
The paper proposes a "compressive transformer", an extension of the transformer, that keeps a compressed long term memory in addition to the fixed sized memory. Both memories can be queried using attention weights. Unlike TransfomerXL that discards the oldest memories, the authors propose to "compress" those memories. The main contribution of this work is that that it introduces a model that can handle extremely long sequences. The authors also introduces a new language modeling dataset based on text from Project Gutenberg that has much longer sequences of words than existing datasets. They provide comprehensive experiments comparing against different compression strategies and compares against previous methods, showing that this method is able to result in lower word-level perplexity. In addition, the authors also present evaluations on speech, and image sequences for RL. <sep> Initially the paper received weak positive responses from the reviewers. The reviewers pointed out some clarity issues with details of the method and figures and some questions about design decisions. After rebuttal, all of the reviewers expressed that they were very satisfied with the authors responses and increased their scores (for a final of 2 accepts and 1 weak accept). <sep> The authors have provided a thorough and well-written paper, with comprehensive and convincing experiments. In addition, the ability to model long-range sequences and dependencies is an important problem and the AC agrees that this paper makes a solid contribution in tackling that problem. Thus, acceptance is recommended.
This paper proposes a solid (if somewhat incremental) improvement on an interesting and well-studied problem. I suggest accepting it.
The authors present an algorithm CHOCO-SGD to make use of communication compression in a decentralized setting. This is an interesting problem, and the paper is well-motivated and well-written. On the theoretical side, the authors prove the convergence rate of the algorithm on non-convex smooth functions, which shows a nearly linear speedup. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets validate the algorithm achieves better performance than baselines. These can be made more convincing by comparing with more baselines (including DeepSqueeze and other centralized algorithms with a compression scheme), and on larger datasets. The authors should also clarify results on consensus.
This paper studies generalizations of Variational Autoencoders to Non-Euclidean domains, modeled as products of constant curvature Riemannian manifolds. The framework allows to simultaneously learn the latent representations as well as the curvature of the latent domain. <sep> Reviewers were unanimous at highlighting the significance of this work at developing non-Euclidean tools for generative modeling. Despite the somewhat preliminary nature of the empirical evaluation, there was consensus that the paper puts forward interesting tools that might spark future research in this direction. Given those positive assessments, the AC recommends acceptance.
This paper proposes methodology to train binary neural networks. <sep> The reviewers and authors engaged in a constructive discussion. All the reviewers like the contributions of the paper. <sep> Acceptance is therefore recommended.
This paper presents a sampling-based approach for generating compact CNNs by pruning redundant filters. One advantage of the proposed method is a bound for the final pruning error. <sep> One of the major concerns during review is the experiment design. The original paper lacks the results on real work dataset like ImageNet. Furthermore, the presentation is a little misleading. The authors addressed most of these problems in the revision. <sep> Model compression and purring is a very important field for real world application, hence I choose to accept the paper.
Although some criticism remains for experiments, I suggest to accept this paper.
This paper considers hierarchical reinforcement learning, and specifically the case where the learning and use of lower-level skills should not be decoupled. To this end the paper proposes Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HiPPO) to jointly learn the different layers of the hierarchy. This is compared against other hierarchical RL schemes on several Mujoco domains. <sep> The reviewers raised three main issues with this paper. The first concerns an excluded baseline, which was included in the rebuttal. The other issues involve the motivation for the paper (in that there exist other methods that try and learn different levels of hierarchy together) and justification for some design choices. These were addressed to some extent in the rebuttal, but I believe this to still be an interesting contribution to the literature, and should be accepted.
The paper proposes an attention mechanism for equivariant neural networks towards the goal of attending to co-occurring features. It instantiates the approach with rotation and reflection transformations, and reports results on rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10. All reviewers have found the idea of using self-attention on top of equivariant feature maps technically novel and sound. There were some concerns about readability which the authors should try to address in the final version.
Three reviewers have assessed this paper and they have scored it as 6/6/6/6 after rebuttal. Nonetheless, the reviewers have raised a number of criticisms and the authors are encouraged to resolve them for the camera-ready submission.
The paper provides theoretical justification for a previously proposed method for uncertainty estimation based on sampling from a prior distribution (Osband et al., Burda et al.). <sep> The reviewers initially raised concerns about significance, clarity and experimental evaluation, but the author rebuttal addressed most of these concerns. <sep> In the end, all the reviewers agreed that the paper deserves to be accepted.
The paper proposes a method to control dynamical systems described by a partial differential equations (PDE). The method uses a hierarchical predictor-corrector scheme that divides the problem into smaller and simpler temporal subproblems. They illustrate the performance of their method on 1D Burger's PDE and 2D incompressible flow. <sep> The reviewers are all positive about this paper and find it well-written and potentially impactful. Hence, I recommend acceptance of this paper.
The paper presents a new take on exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, and presents two approaches, one motivated by information theoretic, the other by decision theoretic influence on other agents. Reviewers consider the proposed approach "pretty elegant, and in a sense seem fundamental", the experimental section "thorough", and expect the work to "encourage future work to explore more problems in this area". Several questions were raised, especially regarding related work, comparison to single agent exploration approaches, and several clarifying questions. These were largely addressed by the authors, resulting in a strong submission with valuable contributions.
The paper considers an interesting algorithm on zeorth-order optimization and contains strong theory. All the reviewers agree to accept.
Main content: <sep> Blind review #1 summarizes it well: <sep> This paper presents a semantic parser that operates over passages of text instead of a structured data source. This is the first time anyone has demonstrated such a semantic parser (Siva Reddy and several others have essentially used unstructured text as an information source for a semantic parser, similar to OpenIE methods, but this is qualitatively different). The key insight is to let the semantic parser point to locations in the text that can be used in further symbolic operations. This is excellent work, and it should definitely be accepted. I have a ton of questions about this method, but they are good questions. <sep> -- <sep> Discussion: <sep> The reviews all agree on a generally positive assessment, and focus on details that have been addressed, rather than major problems. <sep> -- <sep> Recommendation and justification: <sep> This paper should be accepted. Even though novelty in terms of fundamental machine learning components is minimal, but the architecture employing neural models to do symbolic work is a good contribution in a crucial direction (especially in the theme of *CONF*).
This is a very interesting paper which extends natural gradient to output space metrics other than the Fisher-Rao metric (which is motivated by approximating KL divergence). It includes substantial mathematical and algorithmic insight. The method is shown to outperform various other optimizers on a neural net optimization problem that's artificially made ill-conditioned; while it's not clear how practically meaningful this setting is, it seems like a good way to study optimization. I think this paper will be of interest to a lot of researchers and could open up new research directions, so I recommend acceptance as an Oral.
The authors present a hierarchical explanation model for understanding the underlying representations produced by LSTMs and Transformers. Using human evaluation, they find that their explanations are better, which could lead to better trust of these opaque models. <sep> The reviewers raised some issues with the derivations, but the author response addressed most of these.
The paper generalizes several existing results for structured linear transformations in the form of K-matrices. This is an excellent paper and all reviewers confirmed that.
This paper is consistently supported by all three reviewers and thus an accept is recommended.
The paper proposed a new synthetically generated video dataset (CATER) for benchmarking temporal reasoning. The dataset is based on the CLEVR dataset and provides videos make up of primitive actions ("rotate", "pick-place", "slide", "contain") that can be combined to form for complex actions. <sep> The paper also benchmarks a variety of methods on three proposed tasks (atomic action classification, composite action classification, and 'snitch' localization) and demonstrates that while it is possible to get high performance on atomic action classification, the other two task are still challenging and requires temporal modeling. <sep> Overall, all reviewers found the paper to be well written and easy to follow, with care given to the dataset construction, as well as the task definitions and experiment setup and analysis. The paper received strong scores from all reviewers (3 accepts). Based on the reviewer comments, the authors further improved the paper by adding additional relevant datasets for comparison and providing missing details pointed out by the reviewers. After the rebuttal, the reviewers remained positive.
This paper proposes a RNA structure prediction algorithm based on an unrolled inference algorithm. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of previous methods, such as dynamic programming (which does not work for molecular configurations that do not factorize), or energy-based models (which require a minimization step, e.g. by using MCMC to traverse the energy landscape and find minima). <sep> Reviewers agreed that the method presented here is novel on this application domain, has excellent empirical evaluation setup with strong numerical results, and has the potential to be of interest to the wider deep learning community. The AC shares these views and recommends an enthusiastic acceptance.
All three reviewers strongly recommend accepting this paper. It is clear, novel, and a significant contribution to the field. Please take their suggestions into account in a camera ready version. Thanks!
This paper presents a novel option discovery mechanism through incrementally learning reusasble options from a small number of policies that are usable across multiple tasks. <sep> The primary concern with this paper was with a number of issues around the experiments. Specifically, the reviewers took issue with the definition of novel tasks in the Atari context. A more robust discussion and analysis around what tasks are considered novel would be useful. Comparisons to other option discovery papers on the Atari domains is also required. <sep> Additionally, one reviewer had concerns on the hard limit of option execution length which remain unresolved following the discussion. <sep> While this is really promising work, it is not ready to be accepted at this stage.
All reviewers recommend reject, and there is no rebuttal.
The paper proposes a method for performing active learning on graph convolutional networks. In particular, instead of performing uncertainty-based sampling based on an individual node level, the authors propose to look at regional based uncertainty. They propose an efficient algorithm based on page rank. Empirically, they compare their method to several other leading methods, comparing favorably. <sep> Reviewers found the work poorly organized and difficult to read. The idea to use region based estimates is intuitive but feels like nothing more than just that. It's not clear if there is a mathematical basis to justify such a method (e.g. an analysis of sample complexity as has been accomplished in other graph active learning problems, Dasarathy, Nowak, Zhu 2015). <sep> The idea requires further study and justification, and the paper needs an improved exposition. Finally, the authors were not anonymized on the PDF.
The paper aims to find locally interpretable models, such that the local models are fit (w.r.t. the ground truth) and faithful (w.r.t. the global underlying black box model). <sep> The contribution of the paper is that the local model is trained from a subset of points, selected via an optimized importance weight function. The difference compared to Ren et al. (cited) is that the IW function is non-differentiable and optimized using Reinforcement Learning. <sep> A first concern (Rev#1, Rev#2) regards the positioning of the paper w.r.t. RL, as the actual optimization method could be any black-box optimization method: one wants to find the IW that maximizes the faithfulness. The rebuttal makes a good job in explaining the impact of using a non-differentiable IW function. <sep> A second concern (Rev#2) regards the interpretability of the IW underlying the local interpretable model. <sep> There is no doubt that the paper was considerably improved during the rebuttal period. However, the improvements raise additional questions (e.g. about selecting the IW depending on the distance to the probes). I encourage the authors to continue on this promising line of search.
This paper conducted a number of empirical studies to find whether units in object-classification CNN can be used as object detectors. The claimed conclusion is that there are no units that are sufficient powerful to be considered as object detectors. Three reviewers have split reviews. While reviewer #1 is positive about this work, the review is quite brief. In contrast, Reviewer #2 and #3 both rate weak reject, with similar major concerns. That is, the conclusion seems non-conclusive and not surprising as well. What would be the contribution of this type of conclusion to the *CONF* community? In particular, Reviewer #2 provided detailed and well elaborated comments. The authors made efforts to response to all reviewers' comments. However, the major concerns remain, and the rating were not changed. The ACs concur the major concerns and agree that the paper can not be accepted at its current state.
This submission has been assessed by three reviewers who scored it 3/1/3, and they have remained unconvinced after the rebuttal. The main issues voiced are the difficult readability of the paper, cryptic at times due to a mix of physical and DL notations, and a lack of sufficient experimentation to support all claims. The reviewers acknowledge the authors' efforts to resolve the main issues but find these efforts insufficient. Thus, this paper cannot be accepted to *CONF*2020.
Thanks to reviewers and authors for an interesting discussion. It seems the central question is whether learning to identify correct bijections should be part of graph classification problems, or whether this leads to bias and overfitting. Reviews are generally negative, putting this in the lower third of the submissions. The paper, however, inspired an interesting discussion, and I would encourage the authors to continue this line of work, addressing the question of bias and overfitting more directly, possibly going beyond dataset evaluation and, for example, thinking about how to evaluate whether training on non-isomorphic graphs leads to better off-training set generalization.
This paper presents a method for speeding up Gaussian process inference by leveraging locality information through k-nearest neighbours. <sep> The key idea is well-motivated intuitively, however the way in which it is implemented seems to introduce new complications. One such issue is KNN overhead in high dimensions, but R1 outlines other potential issues too. Moreover, the method's merit is not demonstrated in a convincing way through the experiments. The authors have provided a rebuttal for those issues, but it does not seem to solve the concerns entirely.
The work proposes to learn neural networks using a homotopy-based continuation method. Reviewers found the idea interesting, but the manuscript poorly written, and lacking in experimental results. With no response from the authors, I recommend rejecting the paper.
This paper presents a new metric for adversarial attack's detection. The reviewers find the idea interesting, but the some part has not been clearly explained, and there are questions on the reproducibility issue of the experiments.
Based on the Bayesian approach to filtering problem, the paper proves that RNN are universal approximators for the filtering problem. Two reviewers, however, have doubts about the novelty and difficulty to get the result. Although I do not fully agree that Reviewer3 that the proof is just "DNN can fit anything" - it is not this case, but the concerns of Reviewer2 are more strong, especially about the usage of the term "recurrent neural network". The paper is purely theoretical and does not have any numerical experiments, which probably makes it too weak for *CONF* in this form. However, I encourage the authors to continue to work on the subject, since the approach looks very interesting but it still very far from practice.
Two reviewers are negative on this paper while the other one is slightly positive. Overall, this paper does not make the bar of *CONF*. A reject is recommended.
After the rebuttal, the reviewers agree that this paper would benefit from further revisions to clarify issues regarding the motivation of the DP-based security definition, any relationship it may have to standard definitions of privacy, and the role of dimensionality in the theoretical guarantees.
This submission studies an interesting problem. However, as some of the reviewers point out, the novelty of the proposed contributions is fairly limited.
The paper investigates why adversarial training can sometimes degrade model performance on clean input examples. <sep> The reviewers agreed that the paper provides valuable insights into how adversarial training affects the distribution of activations. On the other hand, the reviewers raised concerns about the experimental setup as well as the clarity of the writing and felt that the presentation could be improved. <sep> Overall, I think this paper explores a very interesting direction and such papers are valuable to the community. It's a borderline paper currently but I think it could turn into a great paper with another round of revision. I encourage the authors to revise the draft and resubmit to a different venue.
The reviewers were unanimous that this submission is not ready for publication at *CONF* in its current form. <sep> Concerns raised included that the method was not sufficiently general, including in choice of experiments reported, and the lack of discussion of some lines of significantly related work.
This paper introduces a method for building interpretable classifiers, along with a measure of "concept accuracy" to evaluate interpretability, and primarily applies this method to text models, but includes a proof of concept on images in the appendix. <sep> The main contributions are sensible enough, but the main problems the reviewers had were: <sep> A) The performance of the proposed method <sep> B) The lack of human evaluation of interpretability, and <sep> C) Lack of background and connections to other work. <sep> The authors improved the paper considerably during the rebuttal period, and might have addressed point C) satisfactorily, but only after several back and forths, and at this point it's too late to re-evaluate the paper. I expect that a more polished version of this paper would be acceptable in a future conference. <sep> I mostly ignored R1's review as they didn't seem to put much thought into their review and didn't respond to requests for clarifications.
The authors received reviews from true experts and these experts felt the paper was not up to the standards of *CONF*. <sep> Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 1 disagree as to whether the new notion of generalization error is appropriate. I think both cases can be defended. I think the authors should aim to sharpen their argument in this regard.Several reviewers at one point remark that the results follow from standard techniques: shouldn't this be the case? I believe the actual criticism being made is that the value of these new results do not go above and beyond existing ones. There is also the matter of what value should be attributed to technical developments on their own. On this matter, the reviewers seem to agree that the derivations lean heavily on prior work.
This paper proposes to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by encouraging distribution matching in the latent space. Reviewers 1 and 3 expressed concerns that the methodology is too incremental in the context of the existing literature (VEEGAN, VAE-GAN, AAE). This, combined with the lack of up-to-date baselines, makes it difficult to access the significance of the proposed modifications. The quality and precision of the writing can also be improved to meet the standards of publication at a top-tier conference.
The submission describes a new two-stage training scheme for multi-modal image-to-image translation. The new scheme is compared to a single-stage end-to-end baseline, and the advantage of the new scheme is demonstrated empirically. All three reviewers appreciate the proposed contribution and the quality improvement it brings over the baseline. At the same time, the reviewers see the contribution as incremental and not sufficient for an *CONF* paper. The author response and paper adjustment have not changed the opinion of the reviewers, so the overall recommendation is to reject.
This paper presents sparse attention mechanisms for image captioning. In addition to recent sparsemax based method, authors proposed to extend it by incorporating structural constraints in 2D images, which is called TVMAX. The proposed methods are shown to improve the quality of captioning, particularly in terms of fewer erroneous repetitions, and obtain better human evaluation scores. <sep> Through reviewer discussion, one reviewer updated the score to rejection. A major concern raised by the reviewers is that the motivation of introducing sparse attention is not clear, and the reason why it improves the quality (particularly, why it can reduce repetition) is not convincing. While we understand it is plausible for long sequences as in text domain, we are not convinced that it is really necessary for image captioning problems. Although authors seem to have some ideas, we cannot see how they will be reflected in the paper so I'd like to recommend rejection. <sep> I recommend authors to polish the paper with a clearer description of the motivation and high-level analysis of the method as well as testing on other visual tasks to show its generality.
This paper proposes augmentation of the state exploration strategy that is interesting and has a potential to lead to improvement. However, the current presentation makes it difficult to properly assess that. In particular, the way the authors convey both the underlying intuition and its implementation is fairly vague and does not build confidence in the grounding of the underlying methodology.
The paper proposes a domain-adaptive filter decomposition method via separating domain-specific and cross-domain features, towards learning invariant representations for unsupervised domain adaptation. <sep> Overall, this well-written paper is well motivated with a better technique for learning invariant representations using convolutional filters. Nonetheless, reviewers still have major concerns: 1) the novelty of the paper may be marginal given the significant line of recent work on learning domain-invariant representations; 2) when the label distributions differ, learning invariant representations can only lead to worse target generalizations; 3) the provided theory has an unclear connection to the presented filter decomposition method. The paper can be strengthened by further discussions on how to mitigate the aforementioned negative results. <sep> Hence I recommend rejection.
In this paper dense layers in deep neural networks representing policies are replaced by tensor regression layers, also by a scattering layer, and second-order optimization is considered. The paper does not have a single consistent message, and combines different techniques for unclear reason. Important related work is not cited. The presentation was found unclear by the reviewers.
This paper studies tradeoffs in the design of attention-based architectures. It argues and formally establishes that the expressivity of an attention head is determined by its dimension and that fixing the head dimension, one gains additional expressive power by using more heads. <sep> Reviewers were generally positive about the question under study here, but raised important concerns about the significance of the results and the take-home message in the current manuscript. The AC shares these concerns, and recommends rejection, while encouraging the authors to address the concerns raised during this discussion.
This work claims two primary contributions: first a new saliency method "expected gradients" is proposed, and second the authors propose the idea of attribution priors to improve model performance by integrating domain knowledge during training. Reviewers agreed that the expected gradients method is interesting and novel, and experiments such as Table 1 are a good starting point to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. However, the claimed "novel framework, attribution priors" has large overlap with prior work [1]. One suggestion for improving the paper is to revise the introduction and experiments to support the claim "expected gradients improve model explainability and yield effective attribution priors" rather than claiming to introduce attribution priors as a new framework. One possibility for strengthening this claim is to revisit experiments in [1] and related follow-up work to demonstrate that expected gradients yield improvements over existing saliency methods. Additionally, current experiments in Table 1 only consider integrated gradients as a baseline saliency method, there are many others worth considering, see for example the suite of methods explored in [2]. <sep> Finally, I would add that the current section on distribution shift provides an overly narrow perspective on model robustness by only considering robustness to additive Gaussian noise. It is known that it is easy to improve robustness to Gaussian noise by biasing the model towards low frequency statistics in the data, however this typically results in degraded robustness to other kinds of noise types. See for example [3], where it was observed that adversarial training degrades model robustness to low frequency noise and the fog corruption. If the authors wish to pursue using attribution priors for improving robustness to distribution shift, it is important that they evaluate on a more varied suite of corruptions/noise types [4]. Additionally, one should compare against strong baselines in this area [5]. <sep> 1. https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03717 <sep> 2. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292 <sep> 3. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08988 <sep> 4. https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01697 <sep> 5. https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231
This paper presents an encoder-decoder based approach to construct a compressed latent space representation of each molecule. Then a second neural network segments the output and assigns an atomic number. Unlike previous works using 1D or 2D representations, the proposed method focuses on the 3D representations. <sep> The reviewers have several major concerns. Firstly, the novelty of the paper seems to be limited as the proposed method mainly use the existing techniques. Secondly, there is no clear baseline to compare with. Finally, there is no clear quantitative results to measure the proposed method. The rebuttal did not well address these problems. <sep> Overall, this paper did not meet the standard of *CONF* and I choose to reject the paper.
This paper presents an empirical analysis of the reasons behind BatchNorm vulnerability to adversarial inputs, based on the hypothesis that such vulnerability may be caused by using different statistics during the inference stage as compared to the training stage. While the paper is interesting and clearly written, reviewers point out insufficient empirical evaluation in order to make the claim more convincing.
The paper is develops a self-training framework for graph convolutional networks where we have partially labeled graphs with a limited amount of labeled nodes. The reviewers found the paper interesting. One reviewer notes the ability to better exploit available information and raised questions of computational costs. Another reviewer felt the difference from previous work was limited, but that the good results speak for themselves. The final reviewer raised concerns on novelty and limited improvement in results. The authors provided detailed responses to these queries, providing additional results. <sep> The paper has improved over the course of the review, but due to a large number of stronger papers, was not accepted at this time.
This paper studies the robust reinforcement learning problem in which the constraint on model uncertainty is captured by the Wasserstein distance. The reviewers expressed concerns regarding novelty with respect to prior work, the presentation or the results, and unconvincing experiments. In its current form the paper is not ready for acceptance to *CONF*-2020.
This paper proposes to use stacked layers of Gaussian latent variables with a maxent objective function as a regulariser. I agree with the reviewers that there is very little novelty and the experiments are not very convincing.
This paper has, at its core, a potential for constituting a valuable contribution. However, there was a shared belief among reviewers (that I also share) that the paper still has much room for improvement in terms of presentation and justification of the claims. I hope that the authors will be able to address the feedback they received to make this submission get where it should be.
The paper proposed a new metric to define the quality of optimizers as a weighted average of the scores reached after a certain number of hyperparameters have been tested. <sep> While reviewers (and myself) understood the need to better be able to compare optimizers, they failed to be convinced by the proposed solutions. In particular (setting aside several complaints of the reviewers with which I disagree), by defining a very versatile metric, this paper lacks a strong conclusion as the ranking of optimizers would clearly depend on the instantiation of that metric. <sep> Although that is to be expected, by the very behaviour of these optimizers, it makes it unclear what the added value of the metric is. As one reviewer pointed out, all the points made could have been similarly made with other, more common plots. <sep> Ultimately, it wasn't clear to me what the paper was trying to achieve beyond defining a mathematical formula encompassing all "standard" evaluation metric, which I unfortunately see of limited value.
The paper is well-motivated by neuroscience that our brains use information from outside the receptive field of convolutive processes through top-down mechanisms. However, reviewers feel that the results are not near the state of the art and the paper needs further experiments and need to scale to larger datasets.
Thanks to the reviewers and the authors for an interesting discussion. The reviewers are mixed, learning toward positive, but a few shortcomings were left unaddressed: (i) Turning the task into a mention-pair classification problem ignores the mention detection step, and synergies from joint modeling are lost. (ii) Lee et al. (2018) has been surpassed by some margin by BERT and spanBERT, models ignored in this paper. (iii) Several approaches to aggregating structured annotations have already been introduced, e.g., for sequence labelling tasks. [0] Overall, the limited novelty, the missing baselines, and the missing related work lead me to not favor acceptance at this point. <sep> [0] https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1028/
This paper interprets adaptive gradient methods as trust region methods, and then extends the trust regions to axis-aligned ellipsoids determined by the approximate curvature. It's fairly natural to try to extend the algorithms in this way, but the paper doesn't show much evidence that this is actually effective. (The experiments show an improvement only in terms of iterations, which doesn't account for the computational cost or the increased batch size; there doesn't seem to be an improvement in terms of epochs.) I suspect the second-order version might also lose some of the online convex optimization guarantees of the original methods, raising the question of whether the trust-region interpretation really captures the benefits of the original methods. The reviewers recommend rejection (even after discussion) because they are unsatisfied with the experiments; I agree with their assessment.
All the reviewers recommend rejecting the submission. There is no basis for acceptance.
This paper proposes an attack method to improve the transferability of adversarial examples under black-box attack settings. <sep> Despite the simplicity of the proposed idea, reviewers and AC commonly think that the paper is far from being ready to publish in various aspects: (a) the presentation/writing quality, (b) in-depth analysis and (c) experimental results. <sep> Hence, I recommend rejection.
The paper proposes to combine RL and Imitation Learning. It defines a regularized reward function that minimizes the KL distance between the policy and the expert action. The formulation is similar to the KL regularized MDPs, but with the difference that an additional indicator function based on the support of the expert's distribution is multiplied to the regularized term. <sep> Several issues have been brought up by the reviewers, including: <sep> * Comparison with pre-deep learning literature on the combination of RL and imitation learning <sep> * Similarity to regularized MDP framework <sep> * Assumption 1 requiring a stochastic expert policy, contradicting the policy invariance claim <sep> * Difficulty of learning the indicator function of the support of the expert's data distribution <sep> Some of these issues have been addressed, but at the end of the day, one of the expert reviewers was not convinced that the problem of learning an indicator function is going to be easy at all. The reviewer believes that learning such a function requires "learning a harsh approximation of the density of visits of the expert for every state which is a quite hard task, especially in stochastic environments." <sep> Another issue is related to the policy invariance under the optimal expert policy. In most MDPs, the optimal policy is not stochastic and does not satisfy Assumption 1, so the optimal policy invariance proof seems to contradict Assumption 1. <sep> Overall, it seems that even though this might become a good paper, it requires some improvements. I encourage the authors to address the reviewers' comments as much as possible.
This paper analyzes the non-convergence issue in Adam in a simple non-convex case. The authors propose a new adaptive gradient descent algorithm based on exponential long term memory, and analyze its convergence in both convex and non-convex settings. The major weakness of this paper pointed out by many reviewers is its experimental evaluation, ranging from experimental design to missing comparison with strong baseline algorithms. I agree with the reviewers' evaluation and thus recommend reject.
This paper presents a new link prediction framework in the case of small amount labels using meta learning methods. The reviewers think the problem is important, and the proposed approach is a modification of meta learning to this case. However, the method is not compared to other knowledge graph completion methods such as TransE, RotaE, Neural Tensor Factorization in benchmark dataset such as Fb15k and freebase. Adding these comparisons can make the paper more convincing.
This paper presents a method which creates a representative subset of testing examples so that the model can be tested quickly during the training. The procedure makes use of the famous HGS selection algorithm which identifies and then eliminates the redundant and obsolete test cases based on two criteria: (1) structural coverage as measured by the number of neurons activated beyond a certain threshold, and (2) distribution mismatch (as measured by KL divergence) of the last layer activations. The algorithm has two-phases: (1) a greedy subset selection based on the coverage, and (2) an iterative phase were additional test examples are added until the KL divergence (as defined above) falls below some threshold. <sep> This approach is incremental in nature -- the resulting multi-objective optimisation problem is not a significant improvement over BOT. After the discussion phase, we believe that the advantages over BOT were not clearly demonstrated and that the main drawback of BOT (requiring the number of samples) is not hindering practical applications. Finally, the empirical evaluation is performed on very small data sets and I do not see an efficient way to apply it to larger data sets where this reduction could be significant. Hence, I will recommend the rejection of this paper. To merit acceptance to *CONF* the authors need to provide a cleaner presentation (especially of the algorithms), with a focus on the incremental improvements over BOT, an empirical analysis on larger datasets, and a detailed look into the computational aspects of the proposed approach.
This paper investigated the effect of network width on learned features using activation atlases. From the current view of deep learning, the novelty of the paper is limited. <sep> As all reviews rejected the paper and the authors gave up rebuttal, I choose to reject the paper.
This paper proposes a new model, the Routing Transformer, which endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention from O(n^2) to O(n^1.5). The model attained very good performance on WikiText-103 (in terms of perplexity) and similar performance to baselines (published numbers) in two other tasks. <sep> Even though the problem addressed (reducing the quadratic complexity of self-attention) is extremely relevant and the proposed approach is very intuitive and interesting, the reviewers raised some concerns, notably: <sep> - How efficient is the proposed approach in practice. Even though the theoretical complexity is reduced, more modules were introduced (e.g., forced clustering, mix of local heads and clustering heads, sorting, etc.) <sep> - Why is W_R fixed random? Since W_R is orthogonal, it's just a random (generalized) "rotation" (performed on the word embedding space). Does this really provide sensible "routing"? <sep> - The experimental section can be improved to better understand the impact of the proposed method. Adding ablations, as suggested by the reviewers, would be an important part of this work. <sep> - Not clear why the work needs to be motivated through NMF, since the proposed method uses k-means. <sep> Unfortunately several points raised by the reviewers (except R2) were not addressed in the author rebuttal, and therefore it is not clear if some of the raised issues are fixable in camera ready time, which prevents me from recommend this paper to be accepted. <sep> However, I *do* think the proposed approach is very interesting and has great potential, once these points are clarified. The gains obtained in WikiText-103 are promising. Therefore, I strongly encourage the authors to resubmit this paper taking into account the suggestions made by the reviewers.
This paper proposes a GA-based method for optimizing the loss function a model is trained on to produce better models (in terms of final performance). The general consensus from the reviewers is that the paper, while interesting, dedicates too much of its content to analyzing one such discovered loss (the Baikal loss), and that the experimental setting (MNIST and Cifar10) is too basic to be conclusive. It seems this paper can be so significantly improved with some further and larger scale experiments that it would be wrong to prematurely recommend acceptance. My recommendation is that the authors consider the reviewer feedback, run the suggested further experiments, and are hopefully in the position to submit a significantly stronger version of this paper to a future conference.
This paper is an empirical studies of methods to stabilize offline (ie, batch) RL methods where the dataset is available up front and not collected during learning. This can be an important setting in e.g. safety critical or production systems, where learned policies should not be applied on the real system until their performance and safety is verified. Since policies leave the area where training data is present, in such settings poor performance or divergence might result, unless divergence from the reference policy is regularized. This paper studies various methods to perform such regularization. <sep> The reviewers are all very happy about the thoroughness of the empirical work. The work only studies existing methods (and combination thereof), so the novelty is limited by design. The paper was also considered well written and easy to follow. The results were very similar between the considered regularizers, which somehow limits the usefulness of the paper as practical guideline (although at least now we know that perhaps we do not need to spend a lot of time choosing the best between these). Bigger differences were observed between "value penalties" versus "policy regularization". This seems to correspond to theoretical observations by Neu et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07798, 2017), which is not cited in the manuscript. Although unpublished, I think that work is highly relevant for the current manuscript, and I'd strongly recommend the authors to consider its content. Some minor comments about the paper are given below. <sep> On the balance, the strong point of the paper is the empirical thoroughness and clarity, whereas novelty, significance, and theoretical analysis are weaker points. Due to the high selectivity of *CONF*, I unfortunately have to recommend rejection for this manuscript. <sep> I have some minor comments about the contents of the paper: <sep> - The manuscript contains the line: "Under this definition, such a behavior policy πb is always well-defined even <sep> if the dataset was collected by multiple, distinct behavior policies". Wouldn't simply defining the behavior as a mixture of the underlying behavior policies (when known) work equally well? <sep> - The paper mentions several earlier works that regularize policies update using the KL from a reference policy (or to a reference policy). The paper of Peters is cited in this context, although there the constraint is actually on the KL divergence between state-action distributions, resulting in a different type of regularization.
This work proposes a dynamical systems model to allow the user to better control sequence generation via the latent z. Reviewers all agreed the that the proposed method is quite interesting. However, reviewers also felt that current evaluations were weak and were ultimately unconvinced by the author rebuttal. I recommend the authors resubmit with a stronger set of experiments as suggested by Reviewers 2 and 3.
The authors observe that batch normalization using the statistics computed from a *test* batch significantly improves out-of-distribution detection with generative models. Essentially, normalizing an OOD test batch using the test batch statistics decreases the likelihood of that batch and thus improves detection of OOD examples. The reviewers seemed concerned with this setting and they felt that it gives a significant advantage over existing methods since they typically deal with single test example. The reviewers thus wanted empirical comparisons to methods designed for this setting, i.e. traditional statistical tests for comparing distributions. Despite some positive discussion, this paper unfortunately falls below the bar for acceptance. The authors added significant experiments and hopefully adding these and additional analysis providing some insight into how the batchnorm is helping would make for a stronger submission to a future conference.
The authors propose an invertible flow-based model for molecular graph generation. The reviewers like the idea but have several concerns: in particular, overfitting in the model, need for more experiments and missing related work. It is important for authors to address them in a future submission
The paper proposes a tensor-based extension to graph convolutional networks for prediction over dynamic graphs. <sep> The proposed model is reasonable and achieves promising empirical results. After discussion, it is agreed that while the problem of handling dynamic graphs is interesting and challenging, the proposed tensor method lacks novelty, the theoretical analysis is artificial, and the empirical study does not cover enough benchmarks. <sep> The current version of the paper is not ready for publication. Addressing the issues above could lead to a strong publication in the future.
This paper proposes a new dimensionality reduction technique that tries to preserve the global structure of the data as measured by the relative distances between triplets. As Reviewer 1 noted, the construction of the TriMap algorithm is fairly heuristic, making it difficult to determine how TriMap ought to behave "better" than existing dimensionality reduction approaches other than through qualitative assessment. Here, I share Reviewer 2's concern that the qualitative behavior of TriMap is difficult to distinguish from existing methods in many of the figures.
The authors propose a notion of feature robustness, provide a straightforward decomposition of risk in terms of this robustness measure, and then provide some empirical evidence for their perspective. Across the board, the reviewers raised issues with missing related work, which the authors then addressed. I will point out that some things the authors say about PAC-Bayes are false. E.g., in the rebuttal the authors say that PAC-Bayes is limited to 0-1 error. It is generally trivial to obtain bounds for bounded loss. For unbounded loss functions, there are bounds based on, e.g., sub gaussian assumptions. <sep> Despite improvements in connections with related work, reviewers continued to find the theoretical contributions to be marginal. Even the empirical contributions were found to be marginal.
The submission presents an approach to uncovering causal relations in an environment via interaction. The topic is interesting and the work is timely. However, the experimental setting is quite simplistic and the approach makes strong assumptions that limit its applicability. The reviewers are split. R2 raised their rating from 3 to 6 following the authors' responses and revision, but R1 maintained their rating of 3 and posted a response that justifies this position. In light of the limitations of the work, the AC recommends against accepting the submission.
The authors integrate an interpolation based regularization to develop a graph neural network for semi-supervised learning. While reviewers enjoyed the paper, and the authors have provided a thoughtful response, there were remaining questions about clarity of presentation and novelty remaining after the rebuttal period. The authors are encouraged to continue with this work, accounting for reviewer comments in future revisions.
This paper studies the problem of mode collapse in GANs. The authors present new metrics to judge the model's diversity of the generated faces. The authors present two black-box approaches to increasing the model diversity. The benefit of using a black box approach is that the method does not require access to the weights of the model and hence it is more easily usable than white-box approaches. However, there are significant evaluation problems and lack of theoretical and empirical motivation on why the methods proposed by the paper are good. The reviewers have not changed their score after having read the response and there is still some gaps in evaluation which can be improved in the paper. Thus, I'm recommending a Rejection.
This paper shows a nice idea to transfer knowledge from larger sequence models to small models. However, all the reivewers find that the contribution is too limited and the experiments are insufficient. All the reviewers agree to reject.
This paper has been reviewed by three reviewers and received scores such as 3/3/6. The reviewers took into account the rebuttal in their final verdict. The major criticism concerned the somewhat ad-hoc notion of interpretability, the analysis of vanishing/exploding gradients in TPRU is experimental lacking theory. Finally, all reviewers noted the paper is difficult to read and contains grammar issues etc. which does not help. On balance, we regret that this paper cannot be accepted to *CONF*2020.
The paper is rejected based on unanimous reviews.
The paper presents a framework named Wasserstein-bounded GANs which generalizes WGAN. The paper shows that WBGAN can improve stability. <sep> The reviewers raised several questions about the method and the experiments, but these were not addressed. <sep> I encourage the authors to revise the draft and resubmit to a different venue.
The authors present a new approach to improve performance for retro-synthesis using a seq2seq model, achieving significant improvement over the baseline. There are a number of lingering questions regarding the significance and impact of this work. Hence, my recommendation is to reject.
This paper constitutes interesting progress on an important topic; the reviewers identify certain improvements and directions for future work (see in particular the updates from AnonReviewer1), and I urge the authors to continue to develop refinements and extensions.
The paper proposes a Bayesian optimization approach to creating adversarial examples. The general idea has been in the air for some years, and over the last year especially there have been a number of approaches using BayesOpt for this purpose. Reviewers raised concerns about differences between this approach and related work, and practical challenges in general for using BayesOpt in this domain (regarding dimensionality, etc.). The authors provided thoughtful responses, although some of these concerns still remain. The authors are encouraged to address all comments carefully in future revisions, which a sufficiently substantial that the paper would benefit from additional review.
The consensus of reviewers is that this paper is not acceptable in present form, and the AC concurs.
The paper investigates quantization for speeding up RL. While the reviewers agree that the idea is a good one (it should definitely help), they also have a number of concerns about the paper and presentation. In particular, the reviewers feel that the authors should have provided more insight into the challenges of quantization in RL and the tradeoffs involved. After having read the rebuttals, the reviewers believe that the authors are on the right track, but that the paper is still not ready for publication. If the authors take the reviewer comments and concerns seriously and update their paper accordingly, the reviewers believe that this could eventually result in a strong paper.
This paper introduces a model that learns a slot-based representation and its transition model to predict the representation changes over time. While all the reviewers agree that this paper is focusing on an important problem, they expressed multiple concerns regarding the novelty of the approach as well as lacking experiments. It certainly is missing multiple important relevant works, thereby overclaiming at a few places. The authors provided a short general response to compare their approach with some of the previous works and conduct stronger experiments for a future submission. We believe this paper is not at the stage to be published at this point.
The paper describes an approach for learning context dependent entity representations that encodes fine-grained entity types. The paper includes some good empirical results and observations, but the proposed approach is very simple but lacks technical novelty needed to top ML conference; the clarify of the presentation can also be improved.
This paper studies the effect of training image classifier with masked images to exclude distraction regions in the image and avoid formation of spurious correlation between them and predicted labels. The paper proposes actdiff regularizer and demonstrates that it prevents such overfitting phenomenon on synthetic data. However, there was no success on real data. This is important as it shows that the improvement reported in some saliency-map based approaches in the literature may be due to other regularization effects such as cutout. <sep> This was a unique submission in my batch, as it embraces its negative results. Among our internal discussions, all reviewers that and we all believe that negative results are important and should be encouraged. However, in order for the negative results to be sufficiently insightful for the entire community, they need to be examined under well-organized experiments. This is the aspect that the reviewers think the paper needs to improve on. In particular, R2 believes the paper could consider a larger set of possible regularizations as well as a broader range of applications. The insights in such setting may then lead to solid insights on why the current approaches are not very helpful, and in which direction the follow-up researches should focus on.
The paper proposes an approach for unsupervised learning of keypoint landmarks from images and videos by decomposing them into the foreground and static background. The technical approach builds upon related prior works such as Lorenz et al. 2019 and Jakab et al. 2018 by extending them with foreground/background separation. The proposed method works well for static background achieving strong pose prediction results. The weaknesses of the paper are that (1) the proposed method is a fairly reasonable but incremental extension of existing techniques; (2) it relies on a strong assumption on the property of static backgrounds; (3) video prediction results are of limited significance and scope. In particular, the proposed method may work for simple data like KTH but is very limited for modeling videos as it is not well-suited to handle moving backgrounds, interactions between objects (e.g., robot arm in the foreground and objects in the background), and stochasticity.
The general consensus amongst the reviewers is that this paper is not quite ready for publication, and needs to dig a little deeper in some areas. Some reviewers thought the contributions are unclear, or unsupported. I hope these reviews will help you as you work towards finding a home for this work.
In this work, the authors develop a method for providing frequentist confidence intervals for a range of deep learning models with coverage guarantees. While deep learning models are being used pervasively, providing reasonable uncertainty estimates from these models remains challenging and an important open problem. Here, the authors argue that frequentist statistics can provide confidence intervals along with rigorous guarantees on their quality. They develop a jack-knife based procedure for deep learning. The reviews for this paper were all borderline, with two weak accepts and two weak rejects (one reviewer was added to provide an additional viewpoint). The reviewers all thought that the proposed methodology seemed sensible and well motivated. Among the cited issues, major topics of discussion were the close relation to related work (some of which is very recent, Giordano et al.) and that the reviewers felt the baselines were too weak (or weakly tuned). The reviewers ultimately did not seem convinced enough by the author rebuttal to raise their scores during discussion and there was no reviewer really willing to champion the paper for acceptance. Unfortunately, this paper falls below the bar for acceptance. It seems clear that there is compelling work here and addressing the reviewer comments (relation to related work, i.e. Robbins, Giordano and stronger baselines) would make the paper much stronger for a future submission.
The authors address the problem of training an NMT model on a really massive parallel data set of 40 billion Chinese-English sentence pairs, an order of magnitude bigger than other cz-en experiments. To address noise and training time problems they propose pretraining + a couple of different ways of creating a fine-tuning data set. Two of the reviewers assert that the technical contribution is thin, and the results are SOTA but not really as good as you might hope with this amount of data. This combined with the fact that the data set is not released, makes me think that this paper is not a good fit with *CONF* and would more appropriate for an application focussed conference. The authors engaged strongly with the reviewers, adding more backtranslation results. The reviewers took their responses into account but did not change their scores.
This paper builds a connection between MixUp and adversarial training. It introduces untied MixUp (UMixUp), which generalizes the methods of MixUp. Then, it also shows that DAT and UMixUp use the same method of MixUp for generating samples but use different label mixing ratios. Though it has some valuable theoretical contributions, I agree with the reviewers that it's important to include results on adversarial robustness, where both adversarial training and MixUp are playing an important role.
The paper proposes to augment the conditional GAN discriminator with an attention mechanism, with the aim to help the generator, in the context of image to image translation. The reviewers raise several issues in their reviews. One theoretical concern has to do with how the training of the attention mechanism (which seems to be collaborative) would interact with the minimax, zero-sum nature of a GAN objective; another with the discrepancy in how the attention map is used during training and testing. The experimental results were not significant enough, and the reviewers also recommend additional experiment results to clearly demonstrate the benefit of the method.
This paper proposes to overcome the issue of inconsistent availability of longitundinal data via the combination of leveraging principal components analysis and locality preserving projections. All three reviewers express significant reservations regarding the technical writing in the paper. As it stands, this paper is not ready for publication.
This paper presents to integrate the codes based on multiple hashing functions with Transformer networks to reduce vocabulary sizes in input and output spaces. Compared to non-hashed models, it enables training more complex and powerful models with the same number of overall parameters, thus leads to better performance. <sep> Although the technical contribution is limited considering hash-based approach itself is rather well-known and straightforward, all reviewers agree that some findings in the experiments are interesting. On the cons side, two reviewers were concerned about unclear presentation regarding the details of the method. More importantly, the proposed method is only evaluated on non-standard tasks without comparison to other previous methods. Considering that the main contribution of the paper is in empirical side, I agree it is necessary to evaluate the method on more standard benchmarking tasks in NLP where there should be many other state-of-the-art methods of model compression. For these reasons, I'd like to recommend rejection.
The paper introduces a method for removing what they call representation error and apply the method to super resolution and compressive sensing. <sep> The reviewers have provided constructive feedback. The reviewers like aspects of the paper but are also concerned with various shortcomings. The consensus is that the paper is not ready for publication as it stands. <sep> Rejection is therefore recommended with strong encouragement to keep working on the method and submit elsewhere.
The paper presents an efficient approach to computer saliency measures by exploiting saliency map order equivalence (SMOE), and visualization of individual layer contribution by a layer ordered visualization of information. <sep> The authors did a good job at addressing most issues raised in the reviews. In the end, two major concerns remained not fully addressed: one is the motivation of efficiency, and the other is how much better SMOE is compared with existing statistics. I think these two issue also determines how significance the work is. <sep> After discussion, we agree that while the revised draft pans out to be a much more improved one, the work itself is nothing groundbreaking. Given many other excellent papers on related topics, the paper cannot make the cut for *CONF*.
Thank you very much for the detailed feedback to the reviewers, which helped us better understand your paper. <sep> Thanks also for revising the manuscript significantly; many parts were indeed revised. <sep> However, due to the major revision, we find more points to be further discussed, which requires another round of reviews/rebuttals. <sep> For this reason, we decided not to accept this paper. <sep> We hope that the reviewers' comments are useful for improving the paper for potential future publication.
Thanks for an interesting discussion. The paper introduces a sound question generation technique for QA. Reviewers are moderately positive, with low confidence. Some issues remain unresolved, though: While the UniLM comparison is currently not apples-to-apples, for example, nothing prevents the authors from using their method to pretrain UniLM. Currently, QA results are low-ish, and it is hard to accept a paper based solely on BLEU scores (questionable metric) for question generation (the task is but a means to an end). Moreover, the authors do not really discuss how their method relates to previous work (see Review 2 and the related work cited there; there's more, e.g., [0]). I also find it a little problematic that the paper completely ignores all work prior to 2017: The NLP community started organizing workshops on question generation in 2010. [1]
The authors propose an agent that can act in an RL environment to verify hypotheses about it, using hypotheses formulated as triplets of pre-condition, action sequence, and post-condition variables. Training then proceeds in multiple stages, including a pretraining phase using a reward function that encourages the agent to learn the hypothesis triplets. <sep> Strengths: Reviewers generally agreed it's an important problem and interesting approach <sep> Weaknesses: There were some points of convergence among reviewer comments: lack of connection to existing literature (ie to causal reasoning and POMDPs), and concerns about the robustness of the results (which were only reporting the max seeds). Two reviewers also found the use of natural language to unnecessarily complicate their setup. Overall, clarity seemed to be an issue. Other comments concerned lack of comparisons, analyses, and suggestions for alternate methods of rewarding the agent (to improve understandability). <sep> The authors deserve credit for their responsiveness to reviewer comments and for the considerable amount of additional work done in the rebuttal period. However, these efforts ultimately didn't satisfy the reviewers enough to change their scores. Although I find that the additional experiments and revisions have significantly strengthened the paper, I don't believe it's currently ready for publication at *CONF*. I urge the authors to focus on clearly presenting and integrating these new results in a future submission, which I look forward to.
The paper proposes learning a latent embedding for image manipulation for PixelCNN by using Fisher scores projected to a low-dimensional space. <sep> The reviewers have several concerns about this paper: <sep> * Novelty <sep> * Random projection doesn't learn useful representation <sep> * Weak evaluations <sep> Since two expert reviewers are negative about this paper, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage.
This paper proposes an approach to handle the problem of unsmoothness while modeling spatio-temporal urban data. However all reviewers have pointed major issues with the presentation of the work, and whether the method's complexity is justified.
This paper proposes an outlier detection method that maps outliers to low probability regions of the latent space. The novelty is in proposing a weighted reconstruction error penalizing the mapping of outliers into high probability regions. The reviewers find the idea promising. <sep> They have also raised several questions. It seems the questions are at least partially addressed in the rebuttal, and as a result one of our expert reviewers (R5) has increased their score from WR to WA. But since we did not have a champion for this paper and its overall score is not high enough, I can only recommend a reject at this stage.
The paper proposes metrics for comparing explainability metrics. <sep> Both reviewers and authors have engaged in a thorough discussion of the paper and feedback. The reviewers, although appreciating aspects of the paper, all see major issues with the paper. <sep> All reviewers recommend reject.
The reviewers generally reached a consensus that the work is not quite ready for acceptance in its current form. The central concerns were about the potentially limited novelty of the method, and the fact that it was not quite clear how good the annotations needed to be (or how robust the method would be to imperfect annotations). This, combined with an evaluation scenario that is non-standard and requires some guesswork to understand its difficulty, leaves one with the impression that it is not quite clear from the experiments whether the method really works well. I would recommend for the authors to improve the evaluation in the next submission.
The paper proposed the use of a lossy transform coding approach to to reduce the memory bandwidth brought by the storage of intermediate activations. It has shown the proposed method can bring good memory usage while maintaining the the accuracy. <sep> The main concern on this paper is the limited novelty. The lossy transform coding is borrowed from other domains and only the use of it on CNN intermediate activation is new, which seems insufficient.
The authors extend the framework of randomized smoothing to handle non-Gaussian smoothing distribution and use this to show that they can construct smoothed models that perform well against l2 and linf adversarial attacks. They show that the resulting framework can obtain state-of-the-art certified robustness results improving upon prior work. <sep> While the paper contains several interesting ideas, the reviewers were concerned about several technical flaws and omissions from the paper: <sep> 1) A theorem on strong duality was incorrect in the initial version of the paper, though this was fixed in the rebuttal. However, the reasoning of the authors on the "fundamental trade-off" is specific to the particular framework they consider, and is not really a fundamental trade-off. <sep> 2) The justification for the new family of distributions constructed by the author is not very clear and the experiments only show marginal improvements over prior work. Thus, the significance of this contribution is not clear. <sep> Some of the issues were clarified during the rebuttal, but the reviewers remained unconvinced about the above points. <sep> Thus, the paper cannot be accepted in its current form.
This manuscript investigates and characterizes the tradeoff between fairness and accuracy in neural network models. The primary empirical contribution is to investigate this tradeoff for a variety of datasets. <sep> The reviewers and AC agree that the problem studied is timely and interesting. However, this manuscript also received quite divergent reviews, resulting from differences in opinion about the novelty of the results. IN particular, it is not clear that the idea of a fairness/performance tradeoff is a new one. In reviews and discussion, the reviewers also noted issues with clarity of the presentation. In the opinion of the AC, the manuscript is not appropriate for publication in its current state.
The paper contains interesting ideas for giving simple explanations to a NN; however, the reviewers do not feel the contribution is sufficiently novel to merit acceptance.
The reviewers agree that this is an interesting paper but it required major modifications. After rebuttal, thee paper is much improved but unfortunately not above the bar yet. We encourage the authors to iterate on this work again.
This paper proposes a sensor placement strategy based on maximising the information gain. Instead of using Gaussian process, the authors apply neural nets as function approximators. A limited empirical evaluation is performed to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. <sep> The reviewers have raised several major issues, including the lack of novelty, clarity, and missing critical details in the exposition. The authors didn't address any of the raised concerns in the rebuttal. I will hence recommend rejection of this paper.
The paper proposes to study what information is encoded in different layers of StyleGAN. The authors do so by training classifiers for different layers of latent codes and investigating whether changing the latent code changes the generated output in the expected fashion. <sep> The paper received borderline reviews with two weak accepts and one weak reject. Initially, the reviewers were more negative (with one reject, one weak reject, and one weak accept). After the rebuttal, the authors addressed most of the reviewer questions/concerns. <sep> Overall, the reviewers thought the results were interesting and appreciated the care the authors took in their investigations. The main concern of the reviewers is that the analysis is limited to only StyleGAN. It would be more interesting and informative if the authors applied their methodology to different GANs. Then they can analyze whether the methodology and findings holds for other types of GANs as well. R1 notes that given the wide interest in StyleGAN-like models, the work maybe of interest to the community despite the limited investigation. The reviewers also point out the writing can be improved to be more precise. <sep> The AC agrees that the paper is mostly well written and well presented. However, there are limitations in what is achieved in the paper and it would be of limited interest to the community. The AC recommends that the authors consider improving their work, potentially broadening their investigation to other GAN architectures, and resubmit to an appropriate venue.
The paper improves the previous method for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. <sep> Some theoretical analysis/motivation is interesting as pointed out by a reviewer. I think the paper is well written in overall and has some potential. <sep> However, as all reviewers pointed out, I think experimental results are quite below the borderline to be accepted (considering the *CONF* audience), i.e., the authors should consider non-MNIST-like and more realistic datasets. This indicates the limitation on the scalability of the proposed method. <sep> Hence, I recommend rejection.
Apologies for only receiving two reviews. R2 gave a WR and R3 gave an A. Given the lack of 3rd review and split nature of the scores, the AC has closely scrutinized the paper/reviews/comments/rebuttal. Thoughts: <sep> - Paper is on interesting topic. <sep> - AC agrees with R2's concern about the evaluation not using more complex environments like Mujoco. Without evaluation on a standard benchmark, it is difficult to know objectively if the approach works. <sep> - AC agrees with authors that the DISTRAL approach forms a strong baseline. <sep> - Nevertheless, the experiments aren't super compelling either. <sep> - AC has some concerns about scaling issues w.r.t. model size & #tasks. <sep> The paper is very borderline, but the AC sides with R2's concerns and unfortunately feels the paper cannot be accepted without a stronger evaluation. With this, it would make a compelling paper.
The paper introduces additional layers on top BERT type models for disentangling of semantic and positional information. The paper demonstrates (small) performance gains in transfer learning compared to pure BERT baseline. <sep> Both reviewers and authors have engaged in a constructive discussion of the merits of the proposed method. Although the reviewers appreciate the ideas and parts of the paper the consensus among the reviewers is that the evaluation of the method is not clearcut enough to warrant publication. <sep> Rejection is therefore recommended. Given the good ideas presented in the paper and the promising results the authors are encouraged to take the feedback into account and submit to the next ML conference.
This is an observational work with experiments for comparing iterative pruning methods. <sep> I agree with the main concerns of all reviewers: <sep> (a) Experimental setups are of too small-scale or with easy datasets, so hard to believe they would generalize for other settings, e.g., large-scale residual networks. This aspect is very important as this is an observational paper. <sep> (b) The main take-home contribution/message is weak considering the high-standard of *CONF*. <sep> Hence, I recommend rejection. <sep> I would encourage the authors to consider the above concerns as it could yield a valuable contribution.
In this work, the authors focus on the high-dimensional regime in which both the dataset size and the number of features tend to infinity. They analyze the performance of a simple regression model trained on the random features and revealed several interesting and important observations. <sep> Unfortunately, the reviewers could not reach a consensus as to whether this paper had sufficient novelty to merit acceptance at this time. Incorporating their feedback would move the paper closer towards the acceptance threshold.
The paper proofs that reinforcement learning (using two different algorithms) converge to iterative dominance solutions for a class of multi-player games (dominance solvable games). <sep> There was a lively discussion around the paper. However, two of the reviewers remain unconvinced of the novelty of the approach, pointing to [1] and [2], with [1] only pertaining to supermodular games. The exact contribution over such existing results is currently not addressed in the manuscript. There were also concerns about the scaling and applicability of the results, as dominance solvable games are limited. <sep> [1] http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/guesnerie-roger/milgromroberts90.pdf <sep> [2] Friedman, James W., and Claudio Mezzetti.

All reviewers rated this submission as a weak reject and there was no author response. <sep> The AC recommends rejection.
This paper proposes architectural modifications to transformers, which are promising for sequential tasks requiring memory but can be unstable to optimize, and applies the resulting method to the RL setting, evaluated in the DMLab-30 benchmark. <sep> While I thought the approach was interesting and the results promising, the reviewers unanimously felt that the experimental evaluation could be more thorough, and were concerned with the motivation behind of some of the proposed changes.
The paper proposed the use of dynamic convolutional kernels as a way to reduce inference computation cost, which is a linear combination of static kernels and fused after training for inference to reduce computation cost. The authors evaluated the proposed methods on a variety models and shown good FLOPS reduction while maintaining accuracy. <sep> The main concern for this paper is the limited novelty. There have been many works use dynamic convolutions as pointed out by all the reviewers. The most similar ones are SENet and soft conditional computation. Although the authors claim that soft conditional computation "focus on using more parameters to make models to be more expressive while we focus on reducing redundant calculations", the methods are pretty the same and moreover in the abstract of soft conditional computation they have "CondConv improves the performance and inference cost trade-off".
The authors take inspiration from regulatory fit theory and propose a new parameter for policy gradient algorithms in RL that can manage the "regulatory focus" of an agent. They hypothesize that this can affect performance in a problem-specific way, especially when trading off between broad exploration and risk. The reviewers expressed concerns about the usefulness of the proposed algorithm in practice and a lack of thorough empirical comparisons or theoretical results. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide a rebuttal, so no further discussion of these issues was possible; thus, I recommend to reject.
This paper provides and analyzes an interesting approach to "de-biasing" a predictor from its training set. The work is valuable, however unfortunately just below the borderline for this year. I urge the authors to continue their investigations, for instance further addressing the reviewer comments below (some of which are marked as coming after the end of the feedback period).
The paper addresses the setting of learning with rejection while incorporating the ideas from learning with adversarial examples to tackle adversarial attacks. While the reviewers acknowledged the importance to study learning with rejection in this setting, they raised several concerns: (1) lack of technical contribution -- see R1's and R2's related references, see R3's suggestion on designing c(x); (2) insufficient empirical evidence -- see R3's comment about the sensitivity experiment on the strength of the attack, see R1's suggestion to compare with a baseline that learns the rejection function such as SelectiveNet; (3) clarity of presentation -- see R2's suggestions how to improve clarity. <sep> Among these, (3) did not have a substantial impact on the decision, but would be helpful to address in a subsequent revision. However, (1) and (2) make it very difficult to assess the benefits of the proposed approach, and were viewed by AC as critical issues. <sep> AC can confirm that all three reviewers have read the author responses and have revised the final ratings. AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication. We hope the reviews are useful for improving and revising the paper.
The paper proposes a technique for incorporating prior knowledge as relations between training instances. <sep> The reviewers had a mixed set of concerns, with one common one being an insufficient comparison with / discussion of related work. Some reviewers also found the clarity lacking, but were satisfied with the revision. One reviewer found the claim of the approach being general but only tested and valid for the VQA dataset problematic. <sep> Following the discussion, I recommend rejection at this time, but encourage the authors to take the feedback into account and resubmit to another venue.
This paper proposes to represent the distribution w.r.t. which neural architecture search (NAS) samples architectures through a variational autoencoder, rather than through a fully factorized distribution (as previous work did). <sep> In the discussion, a few things improved (causing one reviewer to increase his/her score from 1 to 3), but it became clear that the empirical evaluation has issues, with a different search space being used for the method than for the baselines. There was unanimous agreement for rejection. I agree with this judgement and thus recommend rejection.
This paper addresses the problem of exploration in challenging RL environments using self-imitation learning. The idea behind the proposed approach is for the agent to imitate a diverse set of its own past trajectories. To achieve this, the authors introduce a policy conditioned on trajectories. The proposed approach is evaluated on various domains including Atari Montezuma's Revenge and MuJoCo. <sep> Given that the evaluation is purely empirical, the major concern is in the design of experiments. The amount of stochasticity induced by the random initial state alone does not lead to convincing results regarding the performance of the proposed approach compared with baselines (e.g. Go-Explore). With such simple stochasticity, it is not clear why one could not use a model to recover from it and then rely on an existing technique like Go-Explore. Although this paper tackles an important problem (hard-exploration RL tasks), all reviewers agreed that this limitation is crucial and I therefore recommend to reject this paper.
The authors show that in a reinforcement learning setting, partial models can be causally incorrect, leading to improper evaluation of policies that are different from those used to collect the data for the model. They then propose a backdoor correction to this problem that allows the model to generalize properly by separating the effects of the stochasticity of the environment and the policy. The reviewers had substantial concerns about both issues of clarity and the clear, but largely undiscussed, connection to off-policy policy evaluation (OPPE). <sep> In response, the authors made a significant number of changes for the sake of clarity, as well as further explained the differences between their approach and the OPPE setting. First, OPPE is not typically model-based. Second, while an importance sampling solution would be technically possible, by re-training the model based on importance-weighted experiences, this would need to be done for every evaluation policy considered, whereas the authors' solution uses a fundamentally different approach of causal reasoning so that a causally correct model can be learned once and work for all policies. <sep> After much discussion, the reviewers could not come to a consensus about the validity of these arguments. Futhermore, there were lingering questions about writing clarity. Thus, in the future, it appears the paper could be significantly improved if the authors cite more of the off policy evaluation literature, in addition to their added textual clairifications of the relation of their work to that body of work. Overall, my recommendation at this time is to reject this paper.
This manuscript describes a continual learning approach where individual instances consist of sequences, such as language modeling. The paper consists of a definition of a problem setting, tasks in that problem setting, baselines (not based on existing continual learning approaches, which the authors argue is to highlight the need for such techniques, but with which the reviewers took issue), and a novel architecture. <sep> Reviews focused on the gravity of the contribution. R1 and R2, in particular, argued that the paper is written as though the problem/benchmark definition is the main contribution. R2 mentions that in spite of this, the methods section jumps directly into the candidate architecture. As mentioned above, several reviewers also took issue with the fact that existing CL techniques are not employed as baselines. The authors engaged with reviewers and promised updates, but did not take the opportunity to update their paper. <sep> As many of the reviewers' comments remain unaddressed and the authors' updates did not materialize, I recommend rejection, and encourage the authors to incorporate the feedback they have received in a future submission.
This paper proposes a new black-box adversarial attack based on tiling and evolution strategies. While the experimental results look promising, the main concern of the reviewers is the novelty of the proposed algorithm, and many things need to be improved in terms of clarity and experiments. The paper does not gather sufficient support from the reviewers even after author response. I encourage the authors to improve this paper and resubmit to future conference.
The author propose a method called global momentum compression for sparse communication setting, and provided some theoretical results on the convergence rate. The convergence result is interesting, but the underlying assumptions used in the analysis appear very strong. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has limited novelty as it is only a minor modification. Another main concern is that the proposed algorithm shows little performance improvement in the experiments. Moreover, more related algorithms should be included in the experimental comparison.
This paper investigates the practical and theoretical consequences of speeding up training using incremental gradient methods (such as stochastic descent) by calculating the gradients with respect to a specifically chosen sparse subset of data. <sep> The reviewers were quite split on the paper. <sep> On the one hand, there was a general excitement about the direction of the paper. The idea of speeding up gradient descent is of course hugely relevant to the current machine learning landscape. The approach was also considered novel, and the paper well-written. <sep> However, the reviewers also pointed out multiple shortcomings. The experimental section was deemed to lack clarity and baselines. The results on standard dataset were very different from expected, causing worry about the reliability, although this has partially been addressed in additional experiments. The applicability to deep learning and large dataset, as well as the significance of time saved by using this method, were other worries. <sep> Unfortunately, I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers that the idea is fascinating, but that more work is required for acceptance to *CONF*.
The paper proposes a generative model that jointly trains an implicit generative model and an explicit energy based model using Stein's method. There are concerns about technical correctness of the proofs and the authors are advised to look carefully into the points raised by the reviewers.
The paper analyses the effect of different loss functions for TransE and argues that certain limitations of TransE can be mitigated by choosing more appropriate loss functions. The submission then proposes TransComplEx to further improve results. This paper received four reviews, with three recommending rejection, and one recommending weak acceptance. A main concern was in the clarity of motivating the different models. Another was in the relatively low performance of RotatE compared with [1], which was raised by multiple reviewers. The authors provided extensive responses to the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, at least the implementation of RotatE remains of concern, with the response of the authors indicating "Please note that we couldn't use exactly the same setting of RotatE due to limitations in our infrastructure." On the balance, a majority of reviewers felt that the paper was not suitable for publication in its current form.
This paper proposes a new graph Hierarchy representation (HAG) which eliminates the redundancy during the aggregation stage and improves computation efficiency. It achieves good speedup and also provide theoretical analysis. There has been several concerns from the reviewers; authors' response addressed them partially. Despite this, due to the large number of strong papers, we cannot accept the paper at this time. We encourage the authors to further improve the work for a future version.
The paper proposes a definition of the sensitivity of the output to random perturbations of the input and its link to generalization. <sep> While both reviewers appreciated the timeliness of this research, they were taken aback by the striking similarity with the work of Novak et al. I encourage the authors to resubmit to a later conference with a lengthier analysis of the differences between the two frameworks, as they started to do in their rebuttal.
This paper proposes a curriculum-based reinforcement learning approach to improve theorem proving towards longer proofs. While the authors are tackling an important problem, and their method appears to work on the environment it was tested in, the reviewers found the experimental section too narrow and not convincing enough. In particular, the authors are encouraged to apply their methods to more complex domains beyond Robinson arithmetic. It would also be helpful to get a more in depth analysis of the role of the curriculum. The discussion period did not lead to improvements in the reviewers' scores, hence I recommend that this paper is rejected at this time.
This paper proposes EXAID, a method to detect adversarial attacks by building on the advances in explainability (particularly SHAP), where activity-map-like explanations are used to justify and validate decisions. Though it may have some valuable ideas, the execution is not satisfying, with various issues raised in comments. No rebuttal was provided.
This works presents a method for inferring the optimal bit allocation for quantization of weights and activations in CNNs. The formulation is sound and the experiments are complete. However, the main concern is that the paper is very similar to a recent work by the authors, which is not cited.
This paper extends the idea of influence functions (aka the implicit function theorem) to multi-stage training pipelines, and also adds an L2 penalty to approximate the effect of training for a limited number of iterations. <sep> I think this paper is borderline. I also think that R3 had the best take and questions on this paper. <sep> Pros: <sep> - The main idea makes sense, and could be used to understand real training pipelines better. <sep> - The experiments, while mostly small-scale, answer most of the immediate questions about this model. <sep> Cons: <sep> - The paper still isn't all that polished. E.g. on page 4: "Algorithm 1 shows how to compute the influence score in (11). The pseudocode for computing the influence function in (11) is shown in Algorithm 1" <sep> - I wish the image dataset experiments had been done with larger images and models. <sep> Ultimately, the straightforwardness of the extension and the relative niche applications mean that although the main idea is sound, the quality and the overall impact of this paper don't quite meet the bar.
The main concern raised by the reviewers is that the paper is difficult to read and potentially unclear. Therefore, the area chair read the paper, and also found it fairly dense and challenging to read. While there may be important discoveries in the paper, the paper in its current form makes it too difficult to read. Since four reviewers (including the AC) struggled to understand the paper, we believe the presentation of the paper should be improved. In particular, the claims of the paper should be better put into context.
Since there were only two official reviews submitted, I reviewed the paper to form a third viewpoint. I agree with reviewer 2 on the following points, which support rejection of the paper: <sep> 1) Only CIFAR is evaluated without Penn Treebank; <sep> 2) The "faster convergence" is not empirically justified by better final accuracy with same amount of search cost; and <sep> 3) The advantage of the proposed ACSA over SBMD is not clearly demonstrated in the paper. <sep> The scores of the two official reviews are insufficient for acceptance, and an additional review did not overturn this view.
Unfortunately, the reviewers of the paper are all not certain about their review, none of them being RL experts. Assessing the paper myself—not being an RL expert but having experience—the authors have addressed all points of the reviewers thoroughly.
This paper proposes to split the GNN operations into two parts and study the effects of each part. While two reviewers are positive about this paper, the other reviewer R1 has raised some concerns. During discussion, R1 responded and indicated that his/her concerns were not addressed in author rebuttal. Overall, I feel the paper is borderline and lean towards reject.
This work tackles the problem of catastrophic forgetting by using Gaussian processes to identify "memory samples" to regularize learning. <sep> Although the approach seems promising and well-motivated, the reviewers ultimately felt that some claims, such as scalability, need stronger justifications. These justifications could come, for example, from further experiments, including ablation studies to gain insights. Making the paper more convincing in this way is particularly desirable since the directions taken by this paper largely overlap with recent literature (as argued by reviewers).
This submission proposes a method to pass sanity checks on saliency methods for model explainability that were proposed in a prior work. <sep> Pros: <sep> -The method is simple, intuitive and does indeed pass the proposed checks. <sep> Cons: <sep> -The proposed method aims to pass the sanity checks, but is not well-evaluated on whether it provides good explanations. Passing these checks can be considered as necessary but not sufficient. <sep> -All reviewers agreed that the evaluation could be improved and most reviewers found the evaluation insufficient. <sep> Given the shortcomings, AC agrees with the majority recommendation to reject.
This work proposes a self-supervised segmentation method: building upon Crawford and Pineau 2019, this work adds a Monte-Carlo based training strategy to explore object proposals. <sep> Reviewers found the method interesting and clever, but shared concerns about the lack of a better comparison to Crawford and Pineau, as well as generally a lack of care in comparisons to others, which were not satisfactorily addressed by authors response. <sep> For these reasons, we recommend rejection.
This paper investigates theories related to networks sparsification, related to mode connectivity and the so-called lottery ticket hypothesis. The paper is interesting and has merit, but on balance I find the contributions not sufficiently clear to warrant acceptance. The authors made substantial changes to the paper which are admirable and which bring it to borderline status.
This paper proposes a multiresolution spectral geometric loss called the zoomout loss to help with matrix completion, and show state-of-the-art results on several recommendation benchmarks, although experiments also show that the result improvements are not always dependent upon the geometric loss itself. <sep> Reviewers find the idea interesting and the results promising but also have important concerns about the experiments not establishing how the approach truly works. Authors have clarified their explanations in the revisions and provided requested experiments (e.g., on the importance of the initialization size), however important reservations re. why the approach works are still not sufficiently addressed, and would require more iterations to fulfill the potential of this paper. <sep> Therefore, we recommend rejection.
All three reviewers felt the paper should be rejected and no rebuttal was offered. So the paper is rejected.
This paper studies deep neural network (DNN) learning curves by leveraging recent connections of (wide) DNNs to kernel methods such as Gaussian processes. <sep> The bulk of the arguments contained in this paper are, thus, for the "kernel regime" rather than "the problem of non-linearity in DNNs", as one reviewer puts it. <sep> When it comes to scoring this paper, it has been controversial. However a lot of discussion has taken place. On the positive side, it seems that there is a lot of novel perspectives included in this paper. On the other hand, even after the revision, it seems that this paper is still very difficult to follow for non-physicists. <sep> Overall, it would be beneficial to perform a more careful revision of the paper such that it can be better appreciated by the targeted scientific community.
The paper proposes a combination graph neural networks and graph generation model (GraphRNN) to model the evolution of dynamic graphs for predicting the topology of next graph given a sequence of graphs. <sep> The problem to be addressed seems interesting, but lacks strong motivation. Therefore it would be better if some important applications can be specified. <sep> The proposed approach lacks novelty. It would be better to point out why the specific combination of two existing models is the most appropriate approach to address the task. <sep> The experiments are not fully convincing. Bigger and comprehensive datasets (with the right motivating applications) should be used to test the effectiveness of the proposed model. <sep> In short, the current version failed to raise excitement from readers due to the reasons above. A major revision addressing these issues could lead to a strong publication in the future.
The paper explores an initialization scheme for the recently introduced linear memory network (LMN) (Bacciu et al., 2019) that is better than random initialization and the approach is tested on various MNIST and TIMIT data sets with positive results. <sep> Reviewer 3 raised concerns about the breadth of experiments and novelty. Reviewer 2 recognized that the model performs well on its MNIST baselines and had concerns about applicability to larger settings. Reviewer 1 acknowledges a very well written paper, but again raises concerns about the thoroughness of the experiments. The authors responded to all three reviewers, responding that the tasks were chosen to match existing work and that the approach is complementary to LSTMs to solve different tasks. Overall the reviewers did not re-adjust their ratings. <sep> There remains questions on scalability and generality, which makes the paper not yet ready for acceptance. We hope that the reviews support the authors further research.
This paper offers a new approach to cross-modal embodied learning that aims to overcome limited vocabulary and other issues. Reviews are mixed. I concur with the two reviewers who say the work is interesting but the contribution is not sufficiently clear for acceptance at this time.
This paper presents a differentiable coarsening approach for graph neural network. It provides the empirical demonstration that the proposed approach is competitive to existing pooling approaches. However, although the paper shows an interesting observation, there are remaining novelty as well as clarity concerns. In particular, the contribution of the proposed work over the graph kernels based on other forms of coarsening such as the early work of Shervashidze et al. as well as higher-order WL (pointed out by Reviewer1) remains unclear. We believe the paper currently lacks comparisons and discussions, and will benefit from additional rounds of future revisions.
This submission has been assessed by three reviewers and scored 3/6/1. The reviewers also have not increased their scores after the rebuttal. Two reviewers pointed to poor experimental results that do not fully support what is claimed in contributions and conclusions. Theoretical support for the reconstruction criterion was considered weak. Finally, the paer is pointed to be a special case of (Zhang 2019). While the paper has some merits, all reviewers had a large number of unresolved criticism. Thus, this paper cannot be accepted by *CONF*2020.
This paper tackles the interesting problem of meta-learning in problem spaces where training "tasks" are scarce. Two criticisms that seems to shared across reviewers are that (i) it is debatable how "novel" the space of meta learning with "few" tasks is, especially since there aren't established standard for how many training tasks should be available, and (ii) the paper could use more comparisons with baseline methods and ablations to understand the contributions. As an AC, I down-weight criticism (i) because I don't feel the paper has to be creating a new problem definition; it's acceptable to make advances within an existing space. However, criticism (ii) seems to remain. After conferring with reviewers it seems that the rebuttal was not strong enough to significantly alter the reviewer's opinions on this issue, and so the paper does not have enough support to justify acceptance. The paper certainly addresses interesting issues, and I look forward to seeing a revised/improved version at another venue.
This work introduces a simple and effective method for ensemble distillation. The method is a simple extension of earlier "prior networks": it differs in which, instead of fitting a single network to mimic a distribution produced by the ensemble, this work suggests to use multi-head (one head per individual ensemble member) in order to better capture the ensemble diversity. This paper experimentally shows that multi-head architecture performs well on MNIST and CIFAR-10 (they added CIFAR-100 in the revised version) in terms of accuracy and uncertainty. <sep> While the method is effective and the experiments on CIFAR-100 (a harder task) improved the paper, the reviewers (myself included) pointed out in the discussion phase that the limited novelty remains a major weakness. The proposed method seems like a trivial extension of the prior work, and does not provide much additional insight. To remedy this shortcoming, I suggest the authors provide extensive experimental supports including various datasets and ablation studies. <sep> Another concern mentioned in the discussion is the fact that these small improvements are in spite of the fact that the proposed method ends up using many more parameters than the baselines. Including and comparing different model sizes in a full fledged experimental evaluation would better convey the trade-offs of the proposed approach.
There is no author response for this paper. The paper addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. The authors build upon the idea from [Zheng,2019], namely finding gradient updates in the space perpendicular to the input vectors of the previous tasks resulting in less forgetting, and propose an improvement, namely to use principal component analysis to enable learning new tasks without restricting their solution space as in [Zheng,2019]. <sep> While the reviewers acknowledge the importance to study continual learning, they raised several concerns that were viewed by the AC as critical issues: (1) convincing experimental evaluation -- an analysis that clearly shows how and when the proposed method can solve the issue that [Zheng,2019] faces with (task similarity/dissimilarity scenario) would substantially strengthen the evaluation and would allow to assess the scope and contributions of this work; also see R3's detailed concerns and questions on empirical evaluation, R2's suggestion to follow the standard protocols, and R1's suggestion to use PackNet and HAT as baselines for comparison; (2) lack of presentation clarity -- see R2's concerns how to improve, and R1's suggestions on how to better position the paper. <sep> A general consensus among reviewers and AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication. It needs clarifications, more empirical studies and polish to achieve the desired goal.
This paper proposed a very general idea called Atomic Compression Networks (ACNs) to construct neural networks. The idea looks simple and effective. However, the reason why it works is not well explained. The experiments are not sufficient enough to convince the reviewers.
The paper propose a new quantization-friendly network training algorithm called GQ (or DQ) net. The paper is well-written, and the proposed idea is interesting. Empirical results are also good. However, the major performance improvement comes from the combination of different incremental improvements. Some of these additional steps do seem orthogonal to the proposed idea. Also, it is not clear how robust the method is to the various hyperparameters / schedules. For example, it seems that some of the suggested training options are conflicting each other. More in-depth discussions and analysis on the setting of the regularization parameter and schedule for the loss term blending parameters will be useful.
The paper tackles the key question of achieving high prediction performances with few labels. The proposed approach builds upon Contrastive Predictive Coding (van den Oord et al. 2018). The contribution lies in i) refining CPC along several axes including model capacity, directional predictions, patch-based augmentation; ii) showing that the refined representation learned by the called CPC.v2 supports an efficient classification in a few-label regime, and can be transferred to another dataset; iii) showing that the auxiliary losses involved in the CPC are not necessarily predictive of the eventual performance of the network. <sep> This paper generated a hot discussion. Reviewers were not convinced that the paper contributions are sufficiently innovative to deserve being published at *CONF*. Authors argued that novelty does not have to lie in equations, and that the new ideas and evidence presented are worth. <sep> The area chair thinks that the paper raises profound questions (e.g., what auxiliary losses are most conducive to learning a good representation; how to divide the computational efforts among the preliminary phase of representation learning and the later phase of classifier learning), but given the number of options and details involved, these results may support several interpretations besides the authors'. <sep> The authors might also want to leave the claim about the generality of the CPC++ principles (e.g., regarding audio) for further work - or to bring additional evidence backing up this claim. <sep> In conclusion, this paper contains brilliant ideas and I hope to see them published with a strengthened analysis of its components.
Main content: <sep> Blind review #3 summarizes it well: <sep> This paper presents a technique for encoding the high level "style" of pieces of symbolic music. The music is represented as a variant of the MIDI format. The main strategy is to condition a Music Transformer architecture on this global "style embedding". Additionally, the Music Transformer model is also conditioned on a combination of both "style" and "melody" embeddings to try and generate music "similar" to the conditioning melody but in the style of the performance embedding. <sep> -- <sep> Discussion: <sep> The reviewers questioned the novelty. Blind review #2 wrote: "Overall, I think the paper presents an interesting application and parts of it are well written, however I have concerns with the technical presentation in parts of the paper and some of the methodology. Firstly, I think the algorithmic novelty in the paper is fairly limited. The performance conditioning vector is generated by an additional encoding transformer, compared to the Music Transformer paper (Huang et. al. 2019b). However, the limited algorithmic novelty is not the main concern. The authors also mention an internal dataset of music audio and transcriptions, which can be a major contribution to the music information retrieval (MIR) community. However it is not clear if this dataset will be publicly released or is only for internal experiments." <sep> However, after revision, the same reviewer has upgraded the review to a weak accept, as the authors wrote "We emphasize that our goal is to provide users with more fine-grained control over the outputs generated by a seq2seq language model. Despite its simplicity, our method is able to learn a global representation of style for a Transformer, which to the best of our knowledge is a novel contribution for music generation. Additionally, we can synthesize an arbitrary melody into the style of another performance, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our results both quantitatively (metrics) and qualitatively (interpolations, samples, and user listening studies)." <sep> -- <sep> Recommendation and justification: <sep> This paper is borderline for the reasons above, and due to the large number of strong papers, is not accepted at this time. As one comment, this work might actually be more suitable for a more specialized conference like ISMIR, as its novel contribution is more to music applications than to fundamental machine learning approaches.
This paper propose a method to train DNNs using 8-bit floating point numbers, by using an enhanced loss scaling method and stochastic rounding method. However, the proposed method lacks novel and both the paper presentation and experiments need to be improved throughout.
The reviewers equivocally reject the paper, which is mostly experimental and the results of which are limited. The authors do not react to the reviewers' comments.
The main contribution is a Bayesian neural net algorithm which saves computation at test time using a vector quantization approximation. The reviewers are on the fence about the paper. I find the exposition somewhat hard to follow. In terms of evaluation, they demonstrate similar performance to various BNN architectures which require Monte Carlo sampling. But there have been lots of BNN algorithms that don't require sampling (e.g. PBP, Bayesian dark knowledge, MacKay's delta approximation), so it seems important to compare to these. I think there may be promising ideas here, but the paper needs a bit more work before it is to be published at a venue such as *CONF*.
This paper has been assessed by three reviewers scoring it as follows: 6, 3, 8. The submission however attracted some criticism post-rebuttal from the reviewers e.g., why concatenating teacher to student is better than the use l2 loss or how the choice of transf. layers has been made (ad-hoc). Similarly, other major criticism includes lack of proper referencing to parts of work that have been in fact developed earlier in preceding papers. On balance, this paper falls short of the expectations of *CONF* 2020, thus it cannot be accepted at this time. The authors are encouraged to work through major comments and resolve them for a future submission.
The authors introduce a method for disentangling effects of correlated predictors in the context of high dimensional outcomes. While the paper contains interesting ideas and has been substantially improved from its original form, the paper still does not meet the quality bar of *CONF* due to its limitations in terms of limited applicability and experiments. The paper will benefit from a revision and resubmission to another venue.
This paper proposes an out-of-distribution detection (OOD) method without assuming OOD in validation. <sep> As reviewers mentioned, I think the idea is interesting and the proposed method has potential. However, I think the paper can be much improved and is not ready to publish due to the followings given reviewers' comments: <sep> (a) The prior work also has some experiments without OOD in validation, i.e., use adversarial examples (AE) instead in validation. Hence, the main motivation of this paper becomes weak unless the authors justify enough why AE is dangerous to use in validation. <sep> (b) The performance of their replication of the prior method is far lower than reported. I understand that sometimes it is not easy to reproduce the prior results. In this case, one can put the numbers in the original paper. Or, one can provide detailed analysis why the prior method should fail in some cases. <sep> (c) The authors follow exactly same experimental settings in the prior works. But, the reported score of the prior method is already very high in the settings, and the gain can be marginal. Namely, the considered settings are more or less "easy problems". Hence, additional harder interesting OOD settings, e.g., motivated by autonomous driving, would strength the paper. <sep> Hence, I recommend rejection.
The paper introduces a distributed algorithm for training deep nets in clusters with high-latency (i.e. very remote) nodes. While the motivation and clarity are the strengths of the paper, the reviewers have some concerns regarding novelty and insufficient theoretical analysis.
This paper studies over-parameterization for unsupervised learning. The paper does a series of empirical studies on this topic. Among other things the authors observe that larger models can increase the number latent variables recovered when fitting larger variational inference models. The reviewers raised some concern about the simplicity of the models studied and also lack of some theoretical justification. One reviewer also suggests that more experiments and ablation studies on more general models will further help clarify the role over-parameterized model for latent generative models. I agree with the reviewers that this paper is "compelling reason for theoretical research on the interplay between overparameterization and parameter recovery in latent variable neural networks trained with gradient descent methods". I disagree with the reviewers that theoretical study is required as I think a good empirical paper with clear conjectures is as important. I do agree with the reviewers however that for empirical paper I think the empirical studies would have to be a bit more thorough with more clear conjectures. In summary, I think the paper is nice and raises a lot of interesting questions but can be improved with more through studies and conjectures. I would have liked to have the paper accepted but based on the reviewer scores and other papers in my batch I can not recommend acceptance at this time. I strongly recommend the authors to revise and resubmit. I really think this is a nice paper and has a lot of potential and can have impact with appropriate revision.
This manuscript investigates the posterior collapse in variational autoencoders and seeks to provide some explanations from the phenomenon. The primary contribution is to propose some previously understudied explanations for the posterior collapse that results from the optimization landscape of the log-likelihood portion of the ELBO. <sep> The reviewers and AC agree that the problem studied is timely and interesting, and closely related to a variety of recent work investigating the landscape properties of variational autoencoders and other generative models. However, this manuscript also received quite divergent reviews, resulting from differences in opinion about the technical difficulty and importance of the results. In reviews and discussion, the reviewers noted issues with clarity of the presentation and sufficient justification of the results. There were also concerns about novelty. In the opinion of the AC, the manuscript in its current state is borderline, and should ideally be improved in terms of clarity of the discussion, and some more investigation of the insights that result from the analysis.
The submission is a detailed and extensive examination of overfitting in vision-and-language navigation domains. The authors evaluate several methods across multiple environments, using different splits of the environment data into training, validation-seen, and validation-unseen. The authors also present an approach using semantic features which is shown to have little or no gap between training and validation performance. <sep> The reviewers had mixed reviews and there was substantial discussion about the merits of the paper. However, a significant issue was observed and confirmed with the authors, relating to tuning the semantic features and agent model on the unseen validation data. This is an important flaw, since the other methods were not tuned in this way, and there was no 'test' performance given in the paper. For this reason, the recommendation is to reject the paper. The authors are encouraged to fairly compare all models and resubmit their paper at another venue.
Unfortunately the paper is confusingly written, and there is only agreement by all reviewers on the rejection of the paper. Indeed, if all reviewers and the area chair do not interpret the paper well, the authors' best response would be to rewrite the papers rather than disagree with all reviewers. <sep> In the area chair's opinion, the current form the paper does not merit publication. The authors are advised to address the reviewers' concerns, rework the paper, and submit to a conference again.
This paper explores training CNNs with labels of differing granularity, and finds that the types of information learned by the method depends intimately on the structure of the labels provided. <sep> Thought the reviewers found value in the paper, they felt there were some issues with clarity, and didn't think the analyses were as thorough as they could be. I thank the authors for making changes to their paper in light of the reviews, and hope that they feel their paper is stronger because of the review process.
The reviewers initially gave scores of 1,1,3 citing primarily weak empirical results and a lack of theoretical justification. The experiments are presented on synthetic examples, which is a great start but the reviewers found that this doesn't give strong enough evidence that the methods developed in the paper would work well in practice. The authors did not submit an author response to the reviewers and as such the scores did not change during discussion. This paper would be significantly strengthened with the addition of experiments on actual problems e.g. related to drug discovery which is the motivation in the paper.
This paper proposes a fractional graph convolutional networks for semi-supervised learning, using a classification function repurposed from previous work, as well as parallelization and weighted combinations of pooling function. This leads to good results on several tasks. <sep> Reviewers had concerns about the part played by each piece, the lack of comparison to recent related work, and asked for better explanation of the rationale of the method and more experimental details. Authors provided explanations and details, and a more thorough set of comparison to other work, showing better performance in some but not all cases. <sep> However, concerns that the proposed innovations are too incremental remain. <sep> Therefore, we cannot recommend acceptance.
The authors propose a model-based RL algorithm, consisting of learning a <sep> deterministic multi-step reward prediction model and a vanilla CEM-based MPC <sep> actor. <sep> In contrast to prior work, the model does not attempt to learn from observations <sep> nor is a value function learned. <sep> The approach is tested on task from the mujoco control suit. <sep> The paper is below acceptance threshold. <sep> It is a variation on previous work form Hafner et al. <sep> Furthermore, I think the approach is fundamentally limited: All the learning <sep> derives from the immediate, dense reward signal, whereas the main challenges in RL <sep> are found in sparse reward settings that require planning over long horizons, where value <sep> functions or similar methods to assign credit over long time windows are <sep> absolutely essential.
This paper pursues an ambitious goal to provide a theoretical analysis HRL in terms of regret bounds. However, the exposition of the ideas has severe clarity issues and the assumptions about HMDPs used are overly simplistic to have an impact in RL research. <sep> Finally, there is agreement between the reviewers and AC that the novelty of the proposed ideas is a weak factor and that the paper needs substantial revision.
This paper presents a method for providing uncertainty for deep learning regressors through assigning a notion of evidence to the predictions. This is done by putting priors on the parameters of the Gaussian outputs of the model and estimating these via an empirical Bayes-like optimization. The reviewers in general found the methodology sensible although incremental in light of Sensoy et al. and Malinin & Gales but found the experiments thorough. A comment on the paper pointed out that the approach was very similar to something presented in the thesis of Malinin (it seems unfair to expect the authors to have been aware of this, but the thesis should be cited and not just the paper which is a different contribution). In discussion, one reviewer raised their score from weak reject to weak accept but the highest scoring reviewer explicitly was not willing to champion the paper and raise their score to accept. Thus the recommendation here is to reject. Taking the reviewer feedback into account, incorporating the proposed changes and adding more careful treatment of related work would make this a much stronger submission to a future conference.
This paper proposes to use a mixture of Gaussians to variationally encode high-dimensional data through a latent space. The latent codes are constrained using the variational information bottleneck machinery. <sep> While the paper is well-motivated and relatively well-written, it contains minimal novel ideas. The consensus in reviews and lack of rebuttal make it clear that this paper should be significantly augmented with novel material before being published to *CONF*.
The paper proposes to use the representation learned via CPC to do reward shaping via clustering the embedding and providing a reward based on the distance from the goal. <sep> The reviewers point out some conceptual issues with the paper, the key one being that the method is contingent on a random policy being able to reach the goal, which is not true for difficult environments that the paper claims to be motivated by. One reviewer noted limited experiment runs and lack of comparisons with other reward shaping methods. <sep> I recommend rejection, but hope the authors find the feedback helpful and submit a future version elsewhere.
The present paper establishes uniform approximation theorems (UATs) for PointNet and DeepSets that do not fix the cardinality of the input set. <sep> Two nonexperts read the paper and came away not understanding what this exercise has taught us and why the weakening of the hypotheses was important. The authors made no attempt to argue these points in their rebuttals and so I went looking at the paper to find the answer in their revisions, but did not find it after scanning through the paper. I think a paper like this needs to explain what is gained and what obstructions earlier approaches met, and why the current techniques side step those. One of the reviewers felt that the fixed cardinality assumption was mild. I'm really not sure why the authors didn't attack this idea. Maybe it is mild in some technical sense? <sep> What I read of the paper seemed excellent in term of style and clarity. I think the paper simply needs to make a better case that it is not merely an exercise in topology. I think the result here is publishable on its own grounds, but for the paper to effectively communicate those findings, the authors should have revised it to address these issues. They chose not to and so I recommend *CONF* take a pass. Once the reviewers revised the framing and scope/impact, provided it doesn't sound trivial, I think it'll be ready for publication.
The authors tackle an interesting and important problem, developing numerical common-sense. They use a crowdsourcing service to collect a dataset and use regression from word embeddings to numerical common sense. <sep> Reviewers were concerned with the size and quality of the dataset, the quality of the prediction methods used, and the analysis of the experimental results. <sep> Given the many concerns, I recommend rejecting the paper, but I encourage the authors to revise the paper to address the concerns and resubmit to another venue.
The reviewers reached a consensus that the paper was not ready to be accepted in its current form. The main concerns were in regard to clarity, relatively limited novelty, and a relatively unsatisfying experimental evaluation. Although some of the clarity concerns were addressed during the response period, the other issues still remained, and the reviewers generally agreed that the paper should be rejected.
There is a clear consensus over all reviewers that this is a very strong empirical analysis, with actionable insights that should prove quite useful both to researchers and practitioners. I have no doubt that many will use it as a reference when implementing and using RL algorithms (especially since the authors said they would release their code). <sep> This is thus a clear accept, that in my opinion would deserve an oral presentation, so as to better disseminate its key findings.
Two knowledgeable reviewers were positive 7 and very positive 10 about this paper, considering it an important contribution that illuminates previously unknown aspects of two classic models, namely RBMs and Hopfield networks. They considered the work very well developed, theoretically interesting and also of potential practical relevance. A third reviewer initially expressed some reservations in regard to the inverse map from RBMs to HNs and the experiments. Following the authors' responses, which the reviewer found detailed and informative, he/she significantly raised his/her score to 7, also emphasizing that he/she hoped to see the paper accepted. With the unanimously positive feedback, I am recommending the paper to be accepted.
The paper proposes a method to grow deep network architectures over the course of training. The work has been extremely well received and has clear novelty and solid experiment validation.
All reviewers agree that this is a well-written and interesting paper that will be of interest to the *CONF* and broader ML community.
This work presents a method to combine EBMs and VAEs in two stages. First, the VAE model is learned; second, an EBM-based correction term is learned via MLE. The methodology is novel and of interest to the *CONF* community.
Three reviewers are positive, while one is negative. The negative reviewer is well-qualified, but the review is not persuasive. Overall, this paper should be published as a wake-up call to the research community. Unfortunately, the lesson of this paper is similar to that of several previous papers, in particular <sep> Armstrong, T. G., Moffat, A., Webber, W., & Zobel, J. (2009, November). Improvements that don't add up: ad-hoc retrieval results since 1998. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management (pp. 601-610). <sep> This submission should be a spotlight, to maximize the chance that future researchers learn its lesson.
All three reviewers are positive, and the authors have addressed essentially all the questions raised by the reviewers. The main insight of the paper is clear, and the empirical results are good, so a spotlight is deserved.
The paper analyzes the gradient flow dynamics of deep equilibrium models with linear activations and establishes linear convergence for quadratic loss and logistic loss; several exciting results and connections, solid contribution, accept!
This work proposes a simple and intuitive way to improve how to learn a communication protocol off-policy in the non-stationary situation in which messages received in the past do not reflect an agent's current policy. The authors introduce a communication correction that relabels the received message adjusting it to the current policy. The authors show that this method, besides being simple, is effective in a number of experiments. As observed by some reviewers, an issue with the method is that it is not clear how it would scale up to more complex environments than those considered. However, the authors addressed the concerns during the response phase, both adding new experiments, and with a clear statement of what are the outstanding issues. The paper is certainly a clever and solid contribution to the area of multi-agent communication learning, and I am strongly in favour of accepting it.
This paper advances the idea that recent "influence estimation" methods for supervised learning cannot be trivially applied to GANs. Based on Hara et al.'s method, the authors propose a novel influence estimation for GANs, and an evaluation scheme based on popular GAN evaluation methods, exploiting the fact that they are differentiable with respect to their input data. The paper demonstrates empirically that the proposed influence estimation method correlates to true influence. It also shows that removing "harmful" instances using the average log-likelihood, Inception Score, and Frechet Inception Distance versions of the proposed metric improves the quality of generated examples. <sep> All reviewers were positive about the paper. R2 pointed out that it was well-written and appreciated the detailed analysis. They thought it thoroughly explained the similarities between it and the most closely-related recent work (Hara et al. and Koh & Liang). Concerns expressed by the reviewer were: the amount of samples needed to be removed to obtain a statistically significant result, lack of qualitative results, and an outdated baseline for anomaly detection. The reviewer also stated that they had some concerns with practical applicability and would like to see more GAN metrics, like Precision & Recall. The authors added qualitative results to the paper which partially satisfied the reviewer. <sep> R1 also thought that the paper was well-written and contributed to the interpretability of GAN training. Like R2, they pointed out the lack of visual examples (addressed in rebuttal), and asked for more insight into what kind of characteristics make a data point influential. They also requested that the authors add a metric that trades fidelity and diversity like P&R. The reviewer originally felt that the paper was below the bar, because it was "like a story without a satisfying conclusion". However, the authors responded with additional analysis which satisfied the reviewer, and they upgraded their score by two points. <sep> R3 also found the paper well-written and interesting, like the other reviewers. The reviewer raised some similar concerns as the other reviewers (e.g. qualitative results), as well as the scalability of the method to relevant architectures, which I thought was surprising that the other reviewers didn't mention. The authors responded that they believe their method succeeded in improving diversity of the generated samples but not their visual quality. This is an important point. <sep> The additions in Appendix D have addressed the main concerns of R1 and R2, as well as R3's concern about lack of visual analysis. R1 seems quite convinced now, and R2, though not changing their score, was already in favour of acceptance. It is an interesting finding that "harmful" instances seem to come from regions of distributional mismatch. <sep> I would like to see a fidelity-diversity tradeoff like P&R added to a paper, and a discussion of this work in relation to DeVries et. al "Instance Selection" that appears to be similarly motivated though executed differently. I think one major thing holding back this paper is the scale of the experimental analysis (Gaussians & MNIST); I hope the authors can scale the method in future work.
This paper has received four positive reviews. The main intellectual contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel readout mechanism that allows models to be shared fully across neurons which in turn helps transfer learning across neurons and even across animals. The reviewers commented on the technical strength of the paper. At the same time, the main contribution remains relatively incremental from a technical standpoint, and while the approach may be of value to future work, the impact of the current study on neuroscience (which is the target here) is quite limited. Nonetheless, there seems to be sufficient enthusiasm from the reviewers to recommend this paper be accepted.
This paper presents a new NAS benchmarks for hardware-aware NAS. For each of the architectures in the search space of NAS-Bench-201, it measures hardware performance (energy cost and latency) for six different hardware devices. This is extremely useful for the NAS research community, since it takes very specialized hardware domain knowledge (including machine learning development frameworks, device compilation, embedded systems, and device measurements) as well as the hardware to make these hardware-aware measurements on as many as six (very different) devices. <sep> The code has been made available to the reviewers during the author response window and has been checked by the reviewers in the meantime. All reviewers appreciated the paper and gave (clear) acceptance scores. <sep> Before this work, it was very hard for the average NAS researcher to assess their method properly in a hardware-aware setting, and I expect this work to change this, and to open up the very important field of hardware-aware NAS to many more researchers. For this reason I recommend to accept this paper as a spotlight.
This paper proposes an efficient attention mechanism linear in time and space using random features. <sep> The approach has some similarities with the simultaneous *CONF* 2021 <sep> submission "Rethinking Attention with Performers", with a key difference of a gating <sep> mechanism present in this work, motivated by recency bias. This paper is a <sep> valuable contributions to the efficient attention research topic. The reviewers <sep> appreciate the experiments and the in-depth analysis. I recommend acceptance. <sep> A noteworthy concern brought up in the discussion period has to do with whether the attention mechanism dominates the feed-forward computations in the neural network, and how much this is architecture-specific. The authors provide TPU timings, but I encourage the authors to add a discussion and timings of relative performance of feed-forward vs. attention layers that covers GPU and CPU optimizers as well.
This paper provides a novel generalization bound for neural networks using knowledge distillation. In particular, they argue that <sep> "test error <= training error + distillation error + distillation complexity" where the distillation complexity is typically much smaller than the original complexity of the neural network. This is motivated by the empirical findings that neural networks can typically be significantly compressed in practice using KD without losing too much accuracy. <sep> I found this result novel and the direction is very promising. This is a clear accept for *CONF*.
This paper addresses a crucial problem with graph convolutions on meshes. <sep> The authors identify the issues related to existing networks and devise a sensible approach. <sep> The work presents a novel message passing GNN operator for meshes that is equivariant under gauge transformations. <sep> The reviewers unanimously agree on the both the importance of the problem and the impact the proposed work could have. <sep> Suggestions for next version: <sep> The paper is unreadable without the appendix and somehow it would be better to make it self-contained <sep> Additional references as suggested in the reviews. <sep> Expanded experiments as suggested by R4, will also improve reader's confidence in the method. <sep> I would recommend acceptance. I would request the authors to release a sufficiently documented and easy to use implementation. This not only allows readers to build on this work but also increase the overall impact of this method.
Reviewers generally agree that the main result of the paper, which generalizes the classical Wigner-Eckart Theorem and provides a basis for the space of G-steerable kernels for any compact group G, is a significant result. There are also several concerns <sep> that need to be addressed. R4 notes that the use of the Dirac delta function (e.g. Theorem C.7) is informal and mathematically imprecise and needs to be fixed. R1 notes that it would be helpful to at least describe how this general formulation can be applied in machine learning. <sep> Presentation and accessibility: the current version of the paper will be accessible to only a small part of the machine learning audience, i.e. those already with advanced knowledge in mathematics and/or theoretical physics, in particular in representation theory. If the authors aim to make it more accessible, the writing would need to be substantially improved.
This is a fairly technical paper bridging deep learning with uncertainty propagation in computations (i.e. probabilistic numerics). It is well structured, but it could benefit from further improvements in readability given that there are only very few researchers that are experts in all sub-domains associated with this work. Given the above, as well as low overall confidence by the reviewers, I attempted a more thorough reading of the paper (even if not an expert myself), and I was also happy to see that the discussion clarified important points. Overall, the idea is novel, convincing and seems well executed, with good results. The technical advancements needed to make the idea work are fairly complicated and are appreciated as contributions, because they are expected to be useful in other applications too (beyond irregular sampled data) where uncertainty propagation matters.
This paper analyzes a version of optimistic value iteration with generalized linear function approximation. Under an optimistic closure assumption, the algorithm is shown to enjoy sublinear regret. The paper also studies error propagation through backups that do not require closed-form characterization of dynamics and reward functions. <sep> Overall, this is a solid contribution and the consensus is to accept.
CausalWorld is a benchmark for robotic manipulation to address transfer and structural learning. The benchmark includes (i) a variety of tasks (picking, pushing, tower, etc) relating to manipulating blocks, (ii) configurable properties for environments (properties of blocks, gravity, etc), (iii) customizable learning settings involving intervention actors, which can change the environment to induce a curriculum. <sep> The reviewers found the paper compelling and with many strengths, including 'interesting and important ideas' (R4), 'simple API with a standardized interface' for 'procedural generation of goals' (R5), 'strongly motivated and tackles a real and practical problem' (R3), and 'benchmark with many good properties' (R2). By and large, the reviewers agree that the paper presents an important benchmark satisfying several desiderata, which I certainly agree with. <sep> On the other hand, most of the reviewers (3 out of 4) also raised serious concerns, more prominently, about the experimental results and the causal inference component. For instance, R5 commented that "all the SOTA algorithms fail," and it is hard to quantify how agents would perform well in different tasks. R3 pointed out the lack of "qualitative results exploring the relationship between the identified and proposed causal variables," emphasizing that 'the benchmark is well-motivated, but not backed up with strong experimental results.'' R2 identified the lack of clear causal component in the paper while the paper mentions "opportunity to investigate causality" and "underlying structural causal model (SCM)." All in all, these are valid concerns. <sep> The authors' rebuttal was quite detailed, and appreciated, but left some important questions unanswered. The first and critical issue is about the causal nature of the simulator. The simulator's name is "causalworld" and its stated goal is to provide "a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment." Also, the first bullet in the list of contributions is: "We propose CausalWorld, a new benchmark comprising a parametrized family of robotic manipulation environments for advancing out-of-distribution generalization and causal structure learning in RL." After reading the paper, I was quite surprised to realize there is no single example of a causal model, in any shape or form (e.g., SCM, DAG, Physics) or a structural learning benchmark. In other words, there is a serious, somewhat nontrivial gap between the claimed contributions and what was realized in the paper. One way to address this issue would be to make the causality more explicit in the paper, for example, by sharing the underlying structural causal model, how variables form causal relationships, what causal structures are being learned, and how these learned structures compare with the ground truth. I think these would be reasonable expectations of a simulator that aims to disentangle the causal aspect of the learning process. <sep> The second issue is about the experimental results in terms of generalizability. The authors emphasized on different occasions that "The primary goal of this work is to provide the tools to build and evaluate generalizable agents in a more systematic fashion, rather than building generalizable agents for the tasks specified," or "the experiments is to showcase the flexibility regarding curricula and performance evaluation schemes offered with CausalWorld, rather than solving new tasks or proposing new algorithms." These responses are somewhat not satisfactory given that the goal of the paper is providing tools to build generalizable agents, while the authors seem to suggest they are not committed to actually building such agents. Specifically, the experiments did not demonstrate the simulator as a benchmark but only showcased its flexibility (i.e., offering a large number of degrees of freedom). One suggestion would be to evaluate how algorithms (agents) with varying degrees of "generalizability" power perform across tasks with various difficulty levels. As it currently stands, the tasks are too easy or too hard for the standard, uncategorized algorithms, which makes it difficult to learn any lessons from running something in the simulator. <sep> Lastly, I should mention that the work has a great potential to introduce causal concepts and causal reasoning to robotics, there is a natural and compelling educational component here. Still, the complete absence of any discussion of causality and the current literature results hurt this connection and the realization of this noble goal. I believe that after reading the paper, the regular causal inference researcher will not be able to understand what assumptions and types of challenges are entailed by this paper and robotics research. On the other hand, the robotics researcher will not be able to understand what a causal model is and the tools currently available in causal reasoning that may be able to help solve the practical challenges of robotics. In other words, this is a huge missed opportunity since there is a complementary nature of what the paper is trying to do in robotics and the results available in causal inference. I believe readers expect and would benefit from having this connection clearly articulated and realized in a more explicit fashion. <sep> If the issues listed above are addressed, I believe the paper can be a game-changer in understanding and investigating robotics & causality. Given the aforementioned potential and reasons, I recommend the paper's acceptance under the assumption that the authors will take the constructive feedback provided in this meta-review into account and revise the manuscript accordingly.
The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning. The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk. The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk. This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively. Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study. The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data. I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries. The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection. After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper. Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers: <sep> R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study. The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear. <sep> R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear. <sep> R#3: Finds the paper not novel as well as trivial or hard to understand. <sep> R#4: The choice of soft error is ad-hoc. <sep> I believe the issues raised by R#3 are not justified. First of all, novelty is very clear and. appreciated by other reviewers. Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial. However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid. Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study. However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score. I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity. A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication. Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication. Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area. Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community. Hence, I decide to accept. However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready. <sep> Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them. For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training. I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research. <sep> A section about limitations should be added. Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section. <sep> Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians. Not providing any theoretical result is always fine but authors should understanding why is it hard to make theoretical statements and where to search them.
This paper presents a hierarchical version of β-TCVAE that promotes disentanglement in the latent space and improves the robustness of VAEs over adversarial attacks, without (much) degeneration on the quality of reconstructions. The analysis on the relationship between disentanglement and adversarial robustness is valuable and the method is new. The results look promising. The comments were properly addressed.
Summary: <sep> This paper introduces a different, interesting definition of safety in RL. The paper does a nice job of showing success with empirical results and providing bounds. I think it provides a nice contribution to the field. <sep> Discussion: <sep> The reviewers agree this paper should be accepted. The initial points brought up against the paper have been successfully addressed or mitigated.
Most of the reviewers agree that this paper presents interesting ideas for an important problem. The paper could be further improved by having a thorough discussion of related works (e.g. Placeto) and construct proxy baselines that reflect these approaches. <sep> The meta-reviewer decided to accept the paper given the positive aspects, and encourages the author to further improve the paper per review comments. <sep> Thank you for submitting the paper to *CONF*.
The work tackles the task to convert an artificial neural networks (ANN) to a spiking neural network (SNN). The topic is potentially important for energy-efficient hardware implementations of neural networks. There is already quite some literature available on this topic. <sep> Compared to these, the manuscript exhibits a number of strong contributions: It presents a theoretical analysis of the conversion error and consequently arrives at a principled way to reduce the conversion error. The authors test the performance of the conversion on a number of challenging data sets. Their method achieves excellent performances with reduced simulation time / latency (usually, in order to achieve comparable performance to ANNs, one needs to run the SNN for many simulated time steps- this simulation time is reduced by their model). <sep> One reviewer criticized that the article was hard to read, but this opinion was not shared by other reviewers and the authors have improved the readability in a revision. <sep> In summary, I believe that this manuscript presents a very good contribution to the field.
The reviewers have different views on the papers but agreed that the paper can be accepted. However, they suggested <sep> some points of improvements including the writing (clarity and style) and experiments showing strong improvements <sep> compared to WGAN.
There is some positive consensus on this paper, which improved somewhat after <sep> the very detailed rebuttal comments by the authors. The use of limited amounts of OOD data is interesting and novel. There were some experimental design problems, but these were well-addressed in rebuttal. <sep> A reviewer points out that <sep> anomaly/outlier detection does not explicitly assume that there is only one <sep> class within the normal class (or in-distribution data). The one-class <sep> assumption is mainly made in some popular anomaly detection methods, such as <sep> one-class classification-based approaches for anomaly detection. The authors <sep> should take this into careful consideration when preparing a final version of <sep> this work.
The paper closes an important gap in our understanding of neural tangent kernels. <sep> In addition, the used techniques are novel. <sep> My low confidence is mainly based on the fact, that the review process at conference is not perfectly suited to deal with such papers, since their review would actually require both expert reviewers and substantially longer reviewing periods.
This paper studies how to improve the worst-case subgroup error in overparameterized models using two simple post-hoc processing techniques. All reviewers were positive about the paper, though R5 questioned the novelty of the paper which built heavily on a few previous papers (in particular, it builds heavily on Sagawa et al. 2020a,b). The AC is satisfied with the authors`' response clarifying the novelty. Given that this topic is quite timely and of interest to the *CONF* community, and that this paper presented a clean investigation on it, the AC recommends acceptance.
This paper proposed an ensemble of diverse models as a mechanism to protect models from theft. <sep> The idea is quite novel. There are some concerns regarding the robustness of the hashing function (that I share), however not every paper has to be perfect, especially when it introduces a novel setup. <sep> AC
This paper proposes a new implementation of a previously proposed two-stage process for video prediction: first predict future segmentation maps, then map them to video frames. Combined with other advances in video prediction and image generation, this simple idea is shown empirically to work very well, producing video predictions up to many hundreds of frames into the future in real stochastic settings with unprecedented quality. Strong ablation studies over the course of the review process further serve to confirm the value of various design choices involved in the implementation.
This paper considers a new setting of robustness, where multiple predictions are simultaneously made based on a single input. Different from existing robustness certificates which independently consider perturbation of each prediction, the authors propose collective robustness certificate that computes the number of predictions which are simultaneously guaranteed to remain stable under perturbation. This yields more optimistic results. Most reviewers think this is a very interesting work and the authors present an effective method to combine individual certificate. The experimental results are convincing. I recommend accept.
This paper studies the link between generalization behavior and "flatness" of the loss landscape in deep networks. Specifically, the authors study two measures of flatness (local entropy and local energy), and show that these two measurements are strongly correlated with one another. Moreover they show via a careful set of numerical experiments that two previously proposed algorithms (entropy SGD and replica SGD) that optimize for local entropy tend to both find flatter minima as well as provide better generalization. <sep> Despite the fact that the paper proposes no new models or algorithms, the experiments are compelling and provide non-trivial insights into predicting generalization behavior of deep networks, as well as solid evidence on the benefits of entropy regularization in SGD. The authors also seem to have satisfactorily answered the (numerous) initial concerns raised by the authors. Overall, I recommend an accept.
Dear Authors, <sep> Thank you very much for your very detailed feedback to the reviewers. They have highly contributed to clarifying some of the concerns raised by the reviewers and improved their understanding of this paper. <sep> Overall, all the reviewers acknowledge the merit of this paper and thus I suggest acceptance of this paper. <sep> However, as Reviewer #4 pointed out, there are conceptual and theoretical issues that need to be more carefully addressed. <sep> Please clarify these issues in the final version of the paper.
This paper proposed a new method to prune neural networks using a continuous penalty function. All reviewers suggest acceptance (some are on borderline though) as the authors did a good job in the rebuttal phase. AC also could not find any particular reason to reject the paper (in particular, the overall writing is clear) and thinks that this paper is a meaningful addition to *CONF* 2021.
Four reviewers have reviewed this paper and after rebuttal, they were overall positive about the proposed idea. We congratulate authors on the paper.
This paper presents an approach to domain adaptation in reinforcement learning. The main idea behind this approach, DARC, is to modify the reward function in the source domain so that the learned policy is optimal in the target domain. This is achieved by learning a classifier that learns to discriminate between the data from the source domain and those from the target domain. <sep> Overall, reviewers appreciated the intuitiveness of the approach as well as its formal analysis. They had some concerns with respect to experiments, which was sorted out in the author response period. Given the overall positive reviews, I recommend accepting the paper.
The paper aims at understanding why self-supervised/contrastive learning methods transfer well when used as pretraining for fine-tuning downstream tasks (compared to e.g., supervised pretraining based on the cross-entropy loss). Three reviewers recommend acceptance, whereas one reviewer recommends borderline rejection, arguing the take home message of the paper is not very clear. While this is a legitimate concern, the AC agrees with the majority that the paper does shed light on the differences between supervised and self-supervised pretraining (based on interesting empirical findings) and recommends acceptance.
This paper considers meta-learning based on MAML. The authors use Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) to develop two meta-learning algorithms that avoid the inner-loop adaptation, which makes MAML computationally intensive. Experimental results demonstrate favorable empirical performance over existing methods. <sep> The paper is generally well written and readable. The proposed methods are well motivated and based on solid theoretical ground. The emprirical performance shows advantages in efficiency and quality. This work is worth acceptence in *CONF* 2021.
This paper presents an empirical study focusing on Bayesian inference on NNGP - a Gaussian process where the kernel is defined by taking the width of a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to the infinity limit. The baselines include a finite width BNN with the same architecture, and a proposed GP-BNN hybrid (NNGP-LL) which is similar to GPDNN and deep kernel learning except that the last-layer GP has its kernel defined by the width-limit kernel. Experiments are performed on both regression and classification tasks, with a focus on OOD data. Results show that NNGP can obtain competitive results comparing to their BNN counterpart, and results on the proposed NNGP-LL approach provides promising supports on the hybrid design as to combine the best from both GP and deep learning fields. <sep> Although the proposed approach is a natural extension of the recent line of work on GP-BNN correspondence, reviewers agreed that the paper presented a good set of empirical studies, and the NNGP-LL approach, evaluated in section 5 with SOTA deep learning architectures, provides a promising direction of future for scalable uncertainty estimation. This is the main reason that leads to my decision on acceptance. <sep> Concerns on section 3's results on under-performing CNN & NNGP results on CIFAR-10 has been raised, which hinders the significance of the results there (since they are way too far from expected CNN accuracy). The compromise for model architecture in order to enable NNGP posterior sampling is understandable, although this does raise questions about the robustness of posterior inference for NNGP in large architectures.
The paper proposes a method for SLAM like dense 3D mapping (colored occupancy grid) based on differentiable rendering with a possibility to provide a probabilistic generative predictive distribution, evaluated on UAVs. <sep> Initially this paper has a wide spread of reviews, with ratings between 4 and 9. Reviewers appreciated the elegant and principled formulation and the interest of the predictive distribution. On the downside, several issues were raised on the incremental nature wrt to DVBF-LM; presentation and writing being very dense and difficult to follow; positioning wrt to prior art; performance with respect to known visual SLAM SOTA baselines; limited evaluations. <sep> The authors provided responses to many of this questions and also updates to the paper, which convinced several reviewers, who unanimously recommended acceptance after discussion. <sep> The AC concurs.
This work develops a novel framework for online continual learning, which they authors name Contextual Transformation Networks (CTN). This framework comprises a base network, which learns to map inputs to a shared feature representation, and a controller that efficiently transforms this shared feature vector to task specific features given a task identifier. Both of these components have access to their own memory. The optimization of the both the controller and base network parameters is framed as a bi-level optimization framework. <sep> Pros: <sep> important and challenging problem <sep> strong results <sep> Cons: <sep> Currently the writing creates the impression of limited novelty from a technical perspective. I would encourage the authors to more crisply highlight the technical novelty of their method.
The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the novelty of the paper and comparisons. The authors were able to address the concerns regarding the comparisons in the response, and the reviewers unanimously agree that the paper should be published. I do think however that this paper is quite borderline. I agree with the reviewers that the updated experiments are convincing in terms of the provided comparisons. However, the reservations I have about the work can perhaps best be stated as follows: There is quite a bit of work in the area of imitation from observations, which makes a range of different assumptions and utilizes a variety of different domain adaptation techniques. Much of this work is in the robotics domain (which is cited in the paper), and much of it demonstrates results in fairly realistic settings, often with real humans and real robots. In comparison, the experiments in this paper are quite simplistic, using toy domains and "demonstrations" obtained from a computational oracle (i.e., another policy). Given the maturity of this field and the current state of the art, I am skeptical of this evaluation, and I think TPIL is a very weak baseline. That said, I would defer to the reviewers in this case -- I do think the particular technical contributions that the paper makes are a valuable addition to the literature, though somewhat incremental. I am also sympathetic to the authors in that much of the more successful prior work in this area that does evaluate under realistic conditions makes subtly different assumptions, or utilizes different techniques for which it is difficult to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. <sep> One thing I would request of the authors for the camera ready though is: Please tone down the claims. "Human-like 7 DOF Striker" is not human-like, it's a crudely simulated robotic arm that was recolored. It would of course be better to have a realistic evaluation (as many prior papers in this field indeed have), but in the absence of that, it is best not to overclaim and be upfront that the evaluation is on relatively simple simulated tasks under conditions that are not necessarily realistic (and have nothing to do with actual humans), but meant rather to evaluate in an apples-to-apples manner the particular algorithmic innovations in the method.
Three out of four reviewers are positive about the paper after the author response and during the discussion. <sep> Strengths include <sep> The proposed method for parameter reduction in transformers allows end-2-end learning cross-modal representations especially on long videos, which has not been possible before <sep> Good performance on audio and video understanding <sep> Extensive set of ablations <sep> Concerns include a somewhat incremental nature of the paper and the still large computational resources to run the experiments. <sep> I think, both, the ideas and results are interesting to the community and recommend accept.
This paper presents two new representation learning tasks (losses) based on contrastive learning that---when combined with a language modeling loss---result in a better multilingual model. Experiments on machine translation and XTREME demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method compared to strong baselines. <sep> I think this is an interesting paper that advances multilingual representation learning. The authors have incorporated many suggestions from the reviewers to improve the paper during the rebuttal period. I recommend to accept the paper, but also strongly suggest the authors to make an official submission to XTREME to validate their results.
The paper shows that using graph neural networks to address multi-task control problems with incompatible environments does not provide benefits to the learning process. The authors instead propose to use Transformers as a simpler mechanism to be able to train and discover the helpful morphological distinctions between agents in order to better solve multitask reinforcement learning problems. <sep> The paper is well written and the analysis of the literature has been appreciated. The contribution is original and relevant to the community. <sep> All the reviewers agree that this paper deserves acceptance. We invite the authors to modify the paper by following the suggestions provided by the reviewers. In particular: <sep> improve the analysis of the empirical results <sep> update the plots <sep> add the suggested references
First as a procedural point, the paper got 7, 7, 5, 5. AnonReviewer3 gave it a 5, but seemed satisfied by the discussion and promised to raise their score. They did not do so, but I must interpret their last messages as indicating they now support the paper. AnonReviewer2, the other 5, had some concerns that other reviewers seem to have helped address during rebuttal. They did not update their score, but were happy to leave their certainty low and defer to other reviewers' recommendation. As such, although the average score looks low in the system, the paper is of an acceptable standard according to reviews. <sep> The paper adapts a method from tabular RL to Deep RL, allowing (as the title aptly says), agents to learn What to do by simulating the past. Reviewers speaking in support of the paper found that the paper was clear and sound in its evaluation, providing interesting results and a useful and reusable method. It is my feeling that after discussion, the case for the paper has been clearly made, and in the absence of any strong objections from the reviewers, I am happy to go with the consensus and recommend acceptance.
The paper proposes a variant of Kanerva Machine Wu et al. (2018) by introducing a spatial transformer to index the memory storage and Temporal Shift Module Lin et al., (2019). The KM++ model learns to encode an exchangeable sequence locally via the spatial transformer. The proposed method is evaluated on conditional image generation tasks. The empirical results demonstrated the nearby keys in the memory encoded related and similar images. Several issues of clarity and the correctness of the main theoretical result were addressed during the rebuttal period in a way that satisfied the reviewers. The basic ideas in the paper are interesting to both the machine learning and the wider cognitive science communities. However, additional experiments should be included in Table 1 to complete the "DKM w/TSM (our impl)" row on Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and DMLab in the final revision for completeness.
This paper presents work on efficient video analysis. The reviewers appreciated the clear formulation and effective methodology. Concerns were raised over empirical validation. The authors' responses added additional material that assisted in clarifying these points. After the discussion the reviewers converged on a unanimous accept rating. The paper contains solid advances in efficient inference for video analysis and is ready for publication.
The paper proposes a novel method for greed layer-wise training by considering the learning signal from either backprop or from the additional auxiliary losses. SEarching for DecOupled Neural Architecture learns to identify the decoupled blocks by learning the gating parameters similar to gradient-based architecture search algorithms, such as DARTs. The empirical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of SEDONA on CIFAR and TinyImageNet using various ResNet architectures. Several issues of clarity and the correctness of the main theoretical result were addressed during the rebuttal period in the way that satisfied the reviewers. The ideas in this paper are interesting and are broadly applicable. Additional experiments / discussions on the tradeoff between initial search cost and accuracy should be included in the final version.
This paper proposes an approach to data augmentation to train image recognition models called SaliencyMix, which involves pasting salient regions (as judged by some saliency detector) of one image into another, and mixing the two labels accordingly. Most reviewers generally agreed that the proposed approach is simple -- it is easy to understand the method and its motivation, especially in the context of related augmentation approaches like CutMix -- and has solid experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. <sep> The main objection the more negative reviewers had to the work is a perceived lack of novelty. In my view it is a new method (even if similar to prior work like CutMix), and as AR5 argues: "this approach probably starts to get to the heart of why these previous strategies work: they are probably less effective ways of doing what this paper suggests." The improvements in Table 1, columns 1 & 3 (CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100) especially speak to this -- these improvements with traditional augmentation disabled are quite substantial, even though the differences become marginal when moving to the "+" augmented versions of the dataset (as well as in ImageNet). So although the method is indeed similar to CutMix, I agree that it offers valuable insight into why these previous methods work. Besides which the results do show improvements over similar methods, even if the improvements are marginal. <sep> Overall, I recommend accepting the paper as it provides useful insight into why prior methods work and proposes a new one that in practice works slightly better. Minor comments for the camera-ready version: <sep> Please revise the writing based on AR4's good suggestions. <sep> Highlighting a comment from AR4: <sep> BAsNet for example, was trained on 10k images. Why not simply include these (and their mask) as part of the pretraining when considering some of the baselines ? <sep> I recommend including discussion of this important point in the final version of the paper. The learning-based approaches are effectively using additional training data. It's good that a non-learning-based method happens to perform best so that the results remain comparable with prior work, but this should nonetheless be discussed if the learning-based approaches are to be included. <sep> Please remove the blue text coloring (if not already planned -- I'm not sure if this was done as a "diff" for the response). <sep> Figure 3(a-b) show that Montabone & Soto (2010) performs better on both the datasets and the effects are identical on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets <sep> I do not see how Figure 3 shows this. Is "OpenCV Saliency" in the figure using the method from Montabone & Soto (2010)? Please clarify this by making the connection between the bar labels in the figure and the discussion in the text clear for the camera-ready version of the paper.
The paper proposes a new teacher-student framework where the teacher network guides the student network in learning useful information from trajectories of a dynamical system. The proposed framework is inspired by the Knowledge Distillation method. The teacher learns what information should be used from the trajectories and distills this information for the student in the form of target activations. In a nutshell, the framework allows the student to interpolate between model-based and model-free approaches in an automated fashion. Experimental evaluation on both the hand-crafted and simulated tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The reviewers had borderline scores in their initial reviews and raised several questions for the authors. The reviewers appreciated the rebuttal, which helped in answering their key questions -- I want to thank the authors for engaging with the reviewers during the discussion phase. The reviewers have an overall positive assessment of the paper, and believe that the proposed teacher-student framework is novel and potentially useful for many real-world problems. The reviewers have provided detailed feedback in their reviews, and I would like to strongly encourage the authors to incorporate this feedback when preparing the final version of the paper.
The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the expressive power of equivariant models for point clouds with respect to translations, rotations and permutations. The authors provide sufficient conditions for universality, and prove that recently introduced architectures, e.g. Tensor Field Networks(TFN), do fulfil this property. <sep> The submission received positive reviews ; after rebuttal, all reviewers recommend acceptance and highlight the valuable paper modifications made by the authors to clarify the intuitions behind the proofs. <sep> The AC also considers that this paper is a solid contribution for *CONF*, which will draw interest for both theoreticians and practitioners in the community. Therefore, the AC recommends acceptance.
The paper focuses on the task of learning efficient representation models for video classification. To avoid the excessive computational cost of performing 3D convolutions on video, the authors propose to break the channel dimension of video representations into sub-dimensions that are treated separately. This cuts down on computation and improves classification performance over many methods in the literature. Extensive experiments were run on well-known benchmarks to justify the claims of the model. Such backbone architectures can be very useful in the realm of video understanding. The authors should be commended for the amount of work they did in the rebuttal period to address the comments and inquiries brought up by the reviewers. Extra experiments were done and more in-depth analysis was made possible.
This paper was unanimously rated above the acceptance threshold by the <sep> reviewers. While all reviewers agree it is worth accepting, they <sep> differed in their enthusiasm. Most reviewers agree that major <sep> limitations of the paper include that the paper provides no insight into why <sep> Dale's principle exists and the actual results are not truly <sep> state-of-the-art. Nevertheless there is agreement that the paper <sep> presents results worth publicizing to the *CONF* audience. The comparison <sep> of the inhibitory network to normalization schemes is interesting. <sep> Also, please reference the Neural Abstraction Pyramid work.
The paper proposed weighted-MOCU, a novel objective-oriented data acquisition criterion for active learning. The propositions are well-motivated, and all reviewers find the analysis of the drawbacks of several popular myopic strategies (e.g. ELR tends to stuck in local optima; BALD tends to be overly explorative)) interesting and insightful. Reviews also appreciate the novelty of the proposed weighted strategy for addressing the convergence issue of MOCU-based approaches. Overall I share the same opinions and believe the paper offers useful insights for the active learning community. <sep> In the meantime, there were shared concerns among several reviewers in the readability (structure and intuition), lack of empirical results on more realistic active learning tasks, and limited discussion on the modeling assumptions. Although the rebuttal revision does improve upon many of these points, the authors are strongly encouraged to take into account the reviews, in particular, to further strengthen the empirical analysis and discussions, when preparing a revision.
This paper proposes a new method for learning a model for spatio-temporal data described by an (unknown) spatio-temporal PDE. The model learns a continuous time PDE using the adjunct method and uses graph networks to perform message passing between different discrete time steps on a grid obtained with Delaunay triangulation. <sep> The method initially 3 favorable and 1 unfavorable ratings, but convincing responses to some of the raised issues led to unanimous recommendations for acceptance (not all reviewer feedback after the rebuttal has been made public, but feedback has been made to the privately AC on these issues by different reviewers). <sep> The reviewers appreciated novelty of the method and numerous ablations. <sep> Initially perceived weaknesses were some key experiments on generalization over different grid discretizations; the simplicity of some experiments, and links to different prior art - many of these points have been dealt with by authors in their response. <sep> The AC concurs and proposes acceptance.
This paper analyses the signal propagation through residual architectures; then suggests a scaling method which, together with weight standardization, allows to train such networks to high accuracy with batch-norm; it demonstrates that the method performs better than previous methods (Fixup, SkipInit), and can be used on more advanced architectures. <sep> The reviewers initially had several concerns, but after the author's revision, these concerns were addressed and most reviewers recommended acceptance. One reviewer did not respond, but I think these concerns were addressed. I think it will help to further convince the readers on the usefulness of the method readers if the authors would check the sensitivity to the learning rate with the current method and compare with other methods (SkipInit, Fixup, BN). The reason I'm suggesting this is that I think one of the main reasons BN is still in popular use is that it commonly tends to make training more robust to changes in hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate (while other methods, like SkipInit and Fixup, require more hyper-parameter tuning). <sep> Overall the analysis and the suggested method seem useful, especially at a small batch size and the writing is mostly clear, so I recommend acceptance.
The authors present a new theoretical framework that establishes that any network can be approximated by pruning a polynomially larger random binary networks, and also an algorithm for pruning binary nets. The results are important in the general context of the "strong" lottery ticket hypothesis, and are of both theoretical and practical interest. Although some of the ideas and technical contributions can be seen as a combination of prior tools and algorithms, the experimental findings are very novel. Some further concerns of clarity and novelty were addressed by the authors.
The authors propose an intriguing alternative to IFT or unrolled GD as a method for optimizing through arg min layers in a neural net, by using a differentiable sampling-based optimization approach. I found the general idea in the paper to be intriguing and thought-provoking. The reviewers generally seem to have also appreciated the method, and many of the reviewers' concerns were addressed by the authors during the rebuttal. Although the paper does have a number of flaws -- in particular, the evaluation is a bit hard to appreciate, since improvement over prior work is either unclear, or no meaningful comparison is offered, -- I think in this case the benefits outweigh the downsides. The work is far from perfect, but the ideas that are presented are interested and valuable to the community, and I think that *CONF* attendees will appreciate learning about this work. I would encourage the authors however to improve the paper, and especially the empirical evaluation, as much as possible for the camera-ready, and to take reviewer comments into account insofar as feasible. I'm also not sure how much I buy the "overfitting to hyperparameters" argument for unrolled GD, and a less charitable interpretation is that the authors present this issue largely to make up for the comparative lack of other benefits. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think making such a big deal of it is a bit strange. It's probably fair to say at this stage that the actual benefits of this approach are a bit modest (though improvements in runtime are a good thing...), but the idea is interesting, and may spur future research.
This paper provides a clear and useful empirical study of how the initialization scale and activations function affects the generalization capability of neural networks. Previous works showing the effect of the initialization scale (Chizat and Bach (2018), Geiger et al. (2019), Woodorth et al. (2020)) had a more limited set of experiments. Moreover, here an extreme case is shown, wherewith sin activation function no generalization is possible at a large init scale (there the kernel regime is useless for generalization since the hidden layer output becomes very sensitive to any small perturbation in the input). Lastly, two alignment measures are suggested, which are correlated with the generalization across several architectures and initialization scales. <sep> All the reviewers argued for acceptance, and one strongly so. I agree that the paper is sufficiently interesting and clear to be accepted. However, despite the high scores, I only recommend a poster and not spotlight/oral: I think the novelty of the empirical study is not groundbreaking, given the experiments in previous works, and the usefulness of the suggested measures are not completely clear without a thorough comparison against previously suggested measures.
This paper proposes a method to cope with large vocabulary sizes. The idea is to find a small number of anchor words and to express every other word as a sparse nonnegative linear combination of them. They give an end-to-end method for training, and give a statistical interpretation of their algorithm as a Bayesian nonparametric prior (in particular an Indian restaurant process). They give extensions that allow them to deduce the optimal number of anchors which allows them to avoid needing to tune this hyperparameter. Finally they give a variety of experiments, particularly in language and recommendation tasks. The results on language are particularly impressive, and in the author response period, at the behest of a reviewer, they were able to extend the experiments to the Amazon Review dataset which contains 233M reviews on 43.5 M items by 15.2 M users. <sep> This paper is a nice combination of a simple but powerful idea, and a range of experiments demonstrating its utility. Other papers have proposed related ideas, but here the main novelty is in (1) using a small number of anchors that can incorporate domain knowledge and (2) using a sparse linear transformation to express other words in this basis. One reviewer did not find the Bayesian nonparametric interpretation to be fruitful, since it does not lead to techniques for handling growing datasets (e.g. if the ideal number of anchors changes over time).
The paper provides a study of the impact of preconditioning/second-order methods on generalization by giving a precise analysis in tractable regression settings. <sep> It illustrates conditions under which preconditioning might be useful for better generalization. <sep> The readability issues raised by the reviewers have been taken into account, as well as some missing references, except <sep> Wu, D. and Xu, J. "On the Optimal Weighted Regularization in Overparameterized Linear Regression" NeurIPS 2020, raised by reviewer (though it is a really recent reference). <sep> Overall the contributions are significant enough to accept the paper for publication.
I agree with the reviewers' comments. The technique proposed in the paper is very interesting, and although the method itself is not particularly surprising (it's "just" chaining two compressors), it's a really nice way of framing and studying the problem. On the other hand, the experiments are relatively weak, and I think there is significant potential for improvement here (especially with an added 9th page of text). I encourage the authors to add some more convincing experiments in future versions of the paper.
This paper is a variant of the large growing class of Neural ODEs, and adds dependency on a time delay to the baseline, which allows to model a larger class of physical systems, in particular adding the possibility of crossing paths in phase space. <sep> After initial evaluation, the paper was on the fence, with 2 reviewers providing favorable reviews, and 2 reviewers recommending rejection. A particular important issue raised was positioning with respect to prior art, [Dupont 2019], with some substantial overlap between the papers; requests of theoretical discussions of the class of studied systems and its properties. <sep> Most of these remarks have been addressed by the authors, in particular positioning and experimental comparisons. <sep> The AC judged that the paper had been sufficiently improved and recommends acceptance.
This paper proposes to enhance the robustness of RL and supervised learning algorithms to noise in the observations by dropping input features that are irrelevant for the task. It relies on the information bottleneck framework (well derived in the paper) and learns a parametric compression of the input features that sets them to zero if they are not relevant for the taskn. The method is extensively evaluated on several RL tasks (exploration in VizDoom and DMLab with a noisy "TV" distractor) and supervised tasks (ImageNet or CIFAR-10 classification with noise). <sep> Reviewers have praised the idea, derivation and writing, as well as the extensive experiments on RL and supervised tasks. Critique focused on: <sep> the contrived nature of the TV noise (localised always in the same corner of the image -- a standard evaluation according to the authors), <sep> lack of comparison with other feature selection methods, <sep> lack of comparison with Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (done during rebuttal), <sep> more general noise than just specific pixels (clarified by the authors as being the features coming out of a convnet) <sep> Given that the reviewers' comments were largely addressed by the authors, and given the final scores of the paper, I will recommend acceptance.
The paper presents a novel method for learning with noisy labels based on an interesting insight into the learning dynamics of deep neural networks. <sep> Reviewers unanimously vote for acceptance. I agree with their assessment, and it is my pleasure to recommend the paper for acceptance. <sep> If I can draw attention to one comment, I strongly agree with R1 that the criterion in Eq. (3) is somewhat poorly motivated. I believe the paper would benefit from a clearer exposition of this part. <sep> Please make sure to address all reviewers' remarks in the camera-ready version. Thank you for submitting your work to *CONF*.
The authors proposed a meta learning framework for NAS, namely MetaD2A (Meta Dataset-to-Architecture), that can stochastically generate graphs (architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a dataset-architecture latent space learned with amortized meta-learning. Each dataset is encoded via a set encoder and the architecutres are obtained via a graph decoder. MetaD2A is trained once on a database consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search a neural architecture for a novel dataset. While the set encoder and graph decoder for NAS have been introduced by existing work, the main contribution of the paper is to show that the meta-learning of a "dataset-conditioned architecture generation" framework can enable fast generation of a good architecture without training on the target dataset. The proposed method is interesting and effective, however it requires an existing pool of good architectures for a given task, which may limit its applicability to a diverse set of real-world problems. I strongly encourage the authors to include experiments on a larger pool of architectures than the NAS-Bench-201 search space to show the strength of their proposed method in generating good architectures. While training MetaD2A with pairs of MetaImageNet and randomly sampled graph shows that the proposed framework can generate graphs with different types of edges, it doesn't show that it can successfully meta-learn to produce better architectures for a new task from an existing pool of good architectures. <sep> We believe that many of the reviewers comments were addressed in the rebuttal, so while the scores are low, they do not reflect neither the contribution nor the reviewers opinion well (e.g., R3, in his last post, seems to suggest that his review should be updated but it has not happened).
The authors present a Bayesian approach for context aggregation in neural processes based models. The article is well written, and provides a nice and comprehensive framework. The reviewers raised some issues regarding the lack of comparisons to proper baselines. The authors provided additional comparisons in the revised version. The comparisons were found satisfactory by some some reviewers, who increased their scores. Based on the revised version, I recommend acceptance.
This paper revisits the under-explored "implicit" variant of Variational Intrinsic Control introduced by Gregor et al. They identify a flaw that biases the original formulation in stochastic environments and propose a fix. <sep> Reviewers agree that there is a [at least a potential, R4] contribution here: "even the description of what implicit VIC is trying to do is a novel contribution of this work", in the words of R2, and "the derivation has theoretical value and is not a simple re-derivation of VIC", in R4's post-rebuttal remarks. Several reviewers raised significant concerns around clarity, which were addressed in an updated manuscript, which also provided new visualizations and new experiments which reviewers found compelling. All reviewers agreed that the revised manuscript was considerably improved. <sep> R4's score stands at the 5, with the other reviewers all standing at 6. R4's main concerns are around whether the missing term in the mutual information identified by the authors is a problem in practice on non-toy tasks (echoing somewhat R3's concerns re: high-dimensional tasks). While this is a valid concern, the function of a conference paper needn't necessarily be to (even attempt) to provide the final word on a matter. Identifying subtle issues such as the one brought forth in this manuscript and re-examining old ideas is a valuable service to the community, and this paper will serve as a beginning to a conversation rather than an end. The AC also considers themselves rather familiar with the original VIC paper, and found the results herein somewhat surprising and noteworthy. <sep> I recommend acceptance, but encourage the authors to incorporate remaining feedback in the camera-ready.
Dear authors, <sep> all reviewers found many interesting contributions in your paper and also pointed out some minor/major issues. In your rebuttal discussions, you addressed most of them to their satisfaction and I hope you will incorporate them carefully also in your final submission. <sep> I hence recommend accepting this paper
The paper analyses several approaches to pruning at initialization, compared to after training. There was a large gap in reviewers appreciation of the paper, but I think that the pros outdo the cons as the paper show a lot of insights overall. I recommend accepting the paper.
This paper presents a new, large-scale, open-domain dataset for on-screen audio-visual separation, and provides an initial solution to this task. As the setting is quite specialized, the authors proposed a neural architecture based on spatial-temporal attentions (while using existing learning objective for audio separation). The reviewers were initially concerned that, while reasonably motivated, the architecture seemed some arbitrary. The authors then provided extensive ablation studies to evaluate the significance of each component with existing datasets, and these efforts are appreciated by reviewers. The authors may consider re-organizing the paper and moving some ablation studies to the main text. On the other hand, the reviewers believe that the dataset will be very useful for the community due to its diversity in content and label quality.
The paper is about adapting a voice generation model to new speakers with minimal amount of training data. The key insight in this paper is that the voice can be adapted using a small set of variables -- the bias and the variance associated with the layer that normalizes the mel-spectrogram associated with the decoder. Additionally, they characterize voice at the utterance level to capture stationary factors like background acoustic conditions and at the phoneme level to capture factors such as prosody, though there are no explicit constraints to force such representation. <sep> The strength of the paper are: <sep> Simplicity of the approach <sep> Empirical evaluation that demonstrates its effectiveness <sep> The weakness of the paper are: <sep> analysis of what the crucial parameters of the model represent <sep> lack of clarity that is obvious from several back-and-forths between the reviewers and the author. <sep> A few examples include: <sep> "There is also a phoneme-level acoustic embedding which is used in the same way, which at inference is taken from random sentences (why not in training?), and, I guess, is supposed to cover phoneme-level idiosyncrasies of the speaker, although this isn't clear to me." <sep> " it is only the speaker embedding that is the input to fine-tuning, and this only via the normalization parameters. (Both the normalization parameters and the speaker embedding itself are fine-tuned.) I am not sure what the speaker-embedding is left to do with all this acoustic-level input, but OK."
The reviewers had a number of concerns which seem to have been addressed by the authors in the discussion phase. All the reviewers are in favor of accepting the paper. The paper provides an interesting/novel idea for federated learning with heterogenous clients/devices.
The paper considers the problem of learning interpretable, low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional multimodal input via weak supervision in a learning from demonstration (LfD) context. To mitigate the disparity between the abstractions that humans reason over and the robot's low-level action and observation spaces, the paper argues for learning a low-dimensional embedding that captures the underlying concepts. The primary contribution of the paper is the ability to learn disentangled low-dimensional representations that are interpretable from weak supervision using conditional latent variable models. <sep> The paper was reviewed by three knowledgeable referees, who read the author response and discussed the paper. The paper considers a challenging problem in learning from demonstration, namely dealing with the disparity that exists between the ways in which humans and robots model and observe the world, a problem that is exacerbated when reasoning over high-dimensional multimodal observations. As the reviewers note, the use of variational inference to learn low-dimensional interpretable representations from weak supervision is compelling. The primary concerns are that the contributions need to be more clearly scoped and that the experimental evaluation is a bit narrow. The authors make an effort to resolve some of these issues, in part through the inclusion of an additional experiment that considers pouring tasks. However, the extent to which this second task mitigates concerns about the narrow evaluation is not fully clear. The paper would be strengthened by the inclusion of experiments in a less contrived setting (and one for which the concepts are not necessarily disjoint) as well as a clearer discussion of the primary contributions.
The major criticism of this paper after the initial reviews was a lack of experimental results on deeper and more modern architectures that include skip connections. The authors added results to the paper to address these issues.
This paper tackles a very important topic in deep RL, namely automatic (non-differentiable) hyper-parameter tuning. It does so by combining ideas from genetic algorithms and neural architecture search with shared experience replay in order to obtain the key property of sample efficiency. The proposed solution is communicated clearly, and the results are compelling (often 10x improvements), as well as qualitatively interesting. <sep> Unfortunately for the authors, their original submission contained only part of the intended results, hence the borderline scores by some reviewers. In the meanwhile, a second suite of experiments have been added, which I think are compelling enough evidence to validate the paper's approach.
This paper takes a step towards understanding the role of nonlinear function approximation--- more specifically, function approximation via (two-layer) neural nets---in some variants of the policy-gradient algorithms. The authors borrow the mean field analysis idea recently popularized in studying shallow neural nets, and investigate the mean-field limits of the training dynamics in the current RL settings. The results and analyses are interesting as they nicely complement another line of linearization-based analyses (i.e., the one based on neural tangent kernels) towards understanding non-linear function approximation. As suggested by a reviewer, it would be nice to add discussions in the revised paper regarding when the dynamics can be guaranteed to converge to a stationary point.
This paper proposes a simple generalization to epsilon-greedy exploration that induces temporally extended probes and can leverage options. The idea and analysis are trivial. Computational results demonstrate when this sort of exploration is helpful. The paper is well written and the authors offer a fair assessment of when these ideas do or do not address challenging exploration tasks. A range of computational results support and offer insight into the concepts.
This paper proposes to use high dimensional representation for labels to strengthen the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improve adversarial robustness. All reviewer agree that the authors propose an interesting idea and this direction deserves further exploration. On the other hand, the reviewers also raise a serious question: There is a lack of explanation of why high dimensional representation of labels improve adversarial robustness. Therefore, it is not clear if the proposed method can defend refined attacks tailored to such dimensional label representation. The authors are highly encouraged to conduct deeper analysis, especially on the robustness against finer attacks.
The paper describes a cool application of online learning from bandit feedback -- creating personalized, adaptive typing interfaces for users with sensorimotor impairments. The problem is well-motivated -- the interface can observe users' gaze (e.g. via a webcam image), predict a character as an action, and bandit feedback can be collected by observing whether users use the backspace key after the interface's action. Prior work showed that gaze-to-text can be less burdensome than typing, but this can quickly become untrue the more mistakes the interface makes. So, the goal is to personalize the interaction policy so that it makes fewer mistakes than the default interaction policy trained using a fixed dataset of expert demonstrations. <sep> The high-point of the paper is the empirical user study with 12-60 participants -- the study convincingly demonstrates that indeed a simple bandit algorithm can improve over the default interface; moreover, users exhibit intriguing co-adaptation patterns with the adaptive interfaces. These findings may prove to be an interesting point for future studies in user co-adaptation. <sep> The low-point of the paper is its algorithmic development. There is a vast literature on bandit/RL algorithms, and incorporating human feedback into their operation (the paper rightly cites TAMER, COACH, etc.) but it is very unclear why any one of these algorithms could not be used for the paper's application. COACH (human feedback gives an explicit view of the action's advantage -- which in the contextual bandit setting exactly matches the paper's assumptions) seems particularly appropriate. Although the algorithm proposed in the paper is simple, how applicable is it in any other context? how does it compare to COACH/etc.? when should we prefer this algorithm over others? Furthermore, given that X2T trains a reward model from observed user-behavior, a natural baseline would use an epsilon-greedy strategy (fraction of the time, pick actions greedily according to the reward model) -- this might isolate the benefit of the approximately Boltzmann exploration being conducted on top of the reward estimates in Eqn 2. Finally, since X2T trains a reward model per user it could be particularly informative to visualize what the models have learned to illustrate qualitatively how X2T is personalizing across its user base. <sep> The paper could have a much bigger impact if the authors can figure out some creative way to enable the broader research community to work on this problem domain. A testbed or environment (like RecSim for content recommendation https://github.com/google-research/recsim) with configurable but realistic reward models could allow researchers to test several bandit algorithms, MDP vs CB formulations, other ways to interpret user feedback etc.
This paper considers a new and practical setting of meta-learning for out-of-domain task adaptation where a pretrained model exists but the original meta-training data is not available. The authors incorporate several ideas including deep ensembles, adversarial training and uncertainty-based step sizes, and achieve competitive performance under this particular setting. <sep> The combination of various methods appears complicated, but the authors provide detailed ablation study to show the effectiveness of each component empirically. During rebuttal and discussion, they addressed many of the concerns from the reviewers. As pointed out by a reviewer, their proposed method would have a value in the domain adaptation area beyond meta-learning. <sep> The remaining concern is on the somewhat ad-hoc combination of multiple methods and lack of a clear single solution for addressing the OOD few-shot learning problem. Nonetheless, the proposed methods show a convincing empirical improvement on the vanilla MAML baseline in the experiments.
This paper shows how multiple tasks can be encoded in a single neural network without the need for explicit modular construction for each task. The idea is very interesting and the research work presented is of high quality. <sep> All the reviewers underline their interest in the presented work. However, there is a deviation in the reviewers' score with half voting <sep> for acceptance and the other half for rejection. The main concern of the fellow reviewers with the below acceptance threshold score was the difficulty in grapsing the theory of the research presented due to the lack of important content from the main manuscript due to space limitations. The authors have an extended supplementary material that covers the whole magnitude of their work. <sep> I understand the reviewers' concern on how such a dense presentation does not do justice and harms the presented effort itself. However, given the edits the authors added to address the issue rasied and the interest and potential of this work - acknowledged by all the reviewers and myself I recommend acceptance. This is a work of a quality I would like to keep seeing in *CONF*.
This paper was controversial amongst the reviewers. There is clear utility to the *CONF* community: a new model of grid cells based on well-known technique (SR) used frequently in ML; good science---careful analysis showing the proposed model exhibits key properties and useful in synthetic navigation domains; such work reminds of the important concerns in natural learning systems which is relevant to those that wish to simulate and build intelligence. Two of the reviewers with subject matter experience in the area advocated for acceptance. <sep> On the other hand, many readers of *CONF* may find the paper confusing and unsatisfying as some of the reviewers did. The empirical work was limited to small domains and mostly in the form of demonstrations---a typically *CONF* reader would expect a performance improvement claim or a scientific hypothesis tested by each experiment. Presented as a new algorithm for ML the paper might appear too limited and simple (e.g., relying on state aggregation). The reviewers with neuro background found the paper clear and well organized, while the ML reviewers found it confusing. The relevance of the work will be limited to a smaller subset of researchers---but this is true of many ML works also. Finally, ML readers might be more familar with neuro work which propose computational models and then validate those models against real neural activity data from brains. This is work is not like that, rather using synthetic data to demonstrate important properties and explore empirical conjectures about the model. <sep> In the end the paper is boarder line: the subject matter experts both listed issues that should be addressed (e.g., band cells issue), while the reaction of the ML reviewers suggests the impact of the work might be reduced at *CONF* (compared to other venues). Additional text clearly articulating the scope and managing reader expectation could mitigate this concern, but it's not a small task to change the tone and pitch this way. Scientific conferences are about insights and understanding, this paper provides both. Please consider the suggested edits to maximize the impact of your work at *CONF* this year.
The paper provides a method for constructing PAC confidence scores for pre-trained deep learning classifiers. The reviewers were all positive about the paper. <sep> Pros: <sep> Has provable guarantees on the reliability of the prediction. Such guarantees are quite desirable in practice. <sep> The problem of neural network uncertainty is important and timely problem, especially in safety-critical applications. <sep> The method is simple and well-motivated. <sep> Strong empirical performance. <sep> Interesting applications to fast DNN inference and safe planning. <sep> Cons: <sep> Lack of generalization guarantees-- the guarantees in the paper only hold on the training set; but in practice, performance in test is what's important. <sep> Only a handful of baselines tested against, most of which (if not all) were naive.
In this paper, the authors combine ideas from SLAM (using an Extended Kalman Filter and a state with nonlinear transitions and warping) and differentiable memory networks that store a spherical representation of the state (from the ego-centric point of view of an RL agent moving in an environment) with depth and visual features stored at each pixel and dynamics transitions corresponding to warping. <sep> The main idea in the paper is very simple and elegant, but I will concur with the reviewers that the writing of the first version of the paper was extremely hard to understand and that the experimental section was too dense. Two subsequent revisions of the paper have dramatically improved the paper. <sep> Given the spread of scores (R1: 6, R2: 7 and R3: 4) and the fact that only R1 and R2 have acknowledged the revisions, I will veer towards acceptance.
Please clarify as early as the abstract that you refine the analysis of the algorithm proposed by Shalev-Shwartz et al (which is a great contribution given the importance of the problem).
Pros: <sep> Provides a practical technique which can dramatically speed up PDE solving -- this is an important and widely applicable contribution. <sep> Paper is simultaneously clearly written and mathematically sophisticated. <sep> The experimental results as impressive. <sep> Cons: <sep> There were concerns that the paper lacks novelty compared to Li et al 2020b, where the underlying theoretical framework was developed. The primary novelty would seem to be: <sep> using Fourier transforms as the specific neural operator <sep> the strength of the experimental results <sep> Overall, I recommend acceptance. I believe the techniques in this paper will be practically useful for future research.
This paper analyses the interaction between data-augmentation strategies and model ensembles with regards to calibration performance. The authors note how strategies such as mixup and label smoothing, which reduce a single model's over-confidence, lead to degradation in calibration performance when such models are combined as an ensemble. They propose a simple solution. The paper merits publication.
This paper proposes "HyperDynamics" a framework that takes into account the history of an agents recent interactions with the environment to predict physical parameters such as mass and friction. These parameters are fed into a forward dynamics model, represented as a neural network, that is used for control. <sep> Pros: <sep> addresses an important problem (adapting dynamics models to "new" environments) and provides strong baselines <sep> well written and authors have improved clarity even further based on reviewers comments <sep> Cons: <sep> I agree with the reviewer that it is currently unclear how well this will transfer to the real world <sep> The idea of predicting physical parameters from a history of environment interactions is not not novel in itself (although the proposed framework is, as far as I know). The authors should include related work along the lines of (1) (this is just one paper that comes to mind, others exist) <sep> (1) Preparing for the Unknown: Learning a Universal Policy with Online System Identification
The authors study co-ordination in multi-agent systems. Specifically they propose a scheme where agents model future trajectories through the environment dynamics and other agents' actions, they then use this to form a plan which forms the agents' intention which is then communicated to the other agents. <sep> The major concerns raised by the reviewers were around novelty, lack of ablations and significance of results as improvements were modest. During the rebuttal, the authors have extended their work with ablations and have conducted a statistical test. While it is true the current results present a small improvement, i think this is an interesting contribution in the field of emergent communication
The paper suggests a procedure to efficiently adapting a learned neural compression model to a new test distribution. If this test distribution has low entropy (e.g., a video as a sequence of interrelated frames), large compression gains can be expected. To achieve these gains, the method adapts the decoder model to the new instance, transmitting not only the data but also a compressed model update. Experiments are carried out on compressing I-frames from videos, while comparisons comprise baseline approaches that finetune the latent representations of videos as opposed to the decoder. <sep> The paper's main contribution is very timely and relevant. While it was well-known in the classical compression literature that model updates could be sent along with the data (e.g., as already done in "optimized JPEG"), this is the first time the idea was implemented in neural compression. The experiments are arguably the paper's weaker part and were originally a concern, but they have been significantly improved during the review period such that all reviewers voted for acceptance. We encourage the authors to further strengthen their experimental results by adding more challenging baselines on well-established tasks (e.g., image compression).
The reviewers have ranked this paper as borderline accept. On the negative side, the main claim of the paper (the more categories for training a one-shot detector, the better) has already been observed in several works and very intuitive. However, the paper has done significant experimental work to support this claim. The paper is very well written, it carefully explores the existing setups for one-shot detection and highlights their weaknesses. The paper also gives advice on how to construct better datasets for one-shot detection (the conclusion "add more diverse categories" is somewhat obvious but the paper demonstrates how important that is).
This paper describes a method called 'stochastic' inverse reinforcement learning. It is somewhat unclear how this differs from other probabilistic approaches to IRL. In particular Bayesian approaches have been used in the past to obtain distributions over reward functions. However, SIRL tries to estimate a generative model over such distributions. All the reviewers foudn the paper suffering from lack of clarity, in particular with respect to how the model/algorithm is constructed. There are some possible technical problems with respect to claims about inferring demonstrations by different experts (cf. work on multi-task IRL). The experiments also seem to be insufficient.
This paper studies the problem of adversarial training for graph neural networks. The proposed method is build on the free training approach, and more specifically FreeLB, with some additional tricks including bias perturbation (for node-classification) and unbounded attacks. While these additions are potentially useful, there are only limited investigation into their effect. Putting aside the technical distinctions of the method with prior work, this paper can also be viewed as an empirical study of adversarial training techniques on graph data with various GNN architectures. It is worth noting that overall the conclusions on "adversarial training" are positive, we do see consistent improvement over a variety of architectures and tasks. The issues however, is that it is unclear whether these improvements can be similarly achieved using prior technique like FreeLB (oblation is only done on one single task, where biased perturbation is shown to lead to minor improvement). The paper also provides some results showing the effect of depth of the network as well as different training strategies such as batch norm, dropout with general adversarial training. These results are interesting to see but do seem to be limited in both scope and depth. It appears that the authors have two goals in mind, one is to propose FLAG and demonstrate its usefulness, and the other is to provide a better understanding of how adversarial training works for GNNs in general. Given the limited novelty of FLAG compared to prior methods, the main contribution actually comes from the later part, which unfortunately is somewhat underdeveloped.
All reviewers agreed on the major shortcomings of this submission, the most important of which is that the contributions are insufficiently evaluated. There was no author response.
This paper explores a network that has a parvo (fine, detailed, slow) <sep> and magno (low-res, quick) stream. The ideas are interesting and the <sep> results intriguing, and one reviewer is in favor of acceptance. <sep> Several reviewers criticized the clarity of the paper. and the lack of <sep> details for, explanations of, and critical evaluation of, the design <sep> decisions. For example, how do the results depend on certain design <sep> decisions? I think that with a bit more work, this paper has potential to <sep> be a very impactful paper. I would encourage the authors to follow the <sep> detailed suggestions and resubmit the work to a high-impact conference or <sep> journal.
One referee supports acceptance, whereas three referees lean towards rejection. All referees agree that the idea introduced in the paper is interesting but find that the motivation and evaluation of the proposed aggregation functions could be significantly strengthened. The rebuttal addresses R1's concerns about novelty and unfair comparisons, R2's concerns about computational efficiency of the methods, R3's concerns about motivation of the proposed approach and some missing baselines, and R4's concerns about motivation. However, the rebuttal does not address the reviewers' concerns related to improvements achieved by the proposed approach, statistical significance nor appropriate comparison with SOTA. I agree with the reviewers that the paper tries to address a relevant problem and proposes interesting ideas, which are worth exploring. However, after discussion, the referees agree that further work should be devoted to strengthen the contribution. I agree with their assessment and hence must reject. In particular, I would strongly recommend to follow their suggestions to either provide strong theoretical motivation to support the claims of the paper or work on a strengthened empirical evaluation, following OGB guidelines to report the std of the results and including a proper comparison with the state of the art.
The paper initially had mixed reviews (4,5,6). The main issues raised were: <sep> limited novelty (re-using/integrating components) [R2]; <sep> limited generalization ability since the model needs to be retrained on every video [R2, R3]; <sep> limited applicability - experiments limited to certain domain of video, while results on videos with large motion are not convincing [R2, R3]; <sep> missing ablation studies / experiments [R3, R4]. <sep> The author response partially addressed some concerns, but the main points 1-3 are still problematic. In addition, the AC noted that the technical aspect was lacking: <sep> Training with contrastive loss on a single video may likely overfit the embedding to the video, which leads to a meaningless embedding where all non-neighboring segments are orthogonal in the embedding space. While changing the softmax temperature can yield higher entropy transition probabilities, the induced probability distribution is probably highly noisy. It would be better to train this on a large video corpus, which will prevent overfitting. Also contrastive loss is typically used to build a discriminative embedding space for classification/recognition, not a smooth embedding space for generation (where distances between embedding vectors are strongly correlated to similarity). Thus some other embedding smoothness terms could be added during contrastive learning. <sep> The learning is only on the transition probabilities, while the video generation is separate. It would have been more convincing to learn the transition probabilities with the video generation process in an end-to-end manner. Perhaps a discriminator could be placed after the video generator so that the transition probabilities could be learned so as to better mimic real video. Other loss terms based on video temporal smoothness could also be added ensure smoother transitions between clips (e.g., motion consistency). <sep> The negative reviewers remained unconvinced by the author response, and the AC agreed with their concerns. Thus, the paper was recommended for rejection.
While it's commonly acknowledged that the paper is well written, the reviews are a bit split: R3 and R1 are mildly positive/negative, respectively, R2 and R4 both voted for reject. R2 asked many questions regarding experiments, which were addressed in the details in the rebuttal. R4 raised 6 questions regarding the bound, and the authors only answered some of them in the rebuttal. R4 felt "the method is lacking in a theoretic proof of a strict bound, which is the primary contribution of the paper". Both R1 and R4 pointed out the proposed algorithm is not practical as expected, especially the results on larger scale such as ImageNet are missing. <sep> The AC cannot agree with the authors' argument that the contribution of the paper is "a conceptual framework that it is possible to certify a watermark for neural networks" in responding to such criticisms. It's indeed very important for this conceptual framework to be proven valuable through thorough experiments and solid comparisons.
This paper considers the problem of searching over the joint space of hardware and neural architectures to trade-off accuracy and latency. <sep> Reviewers raised some valid questions about the following aspects: <sep> Low technical novelty <sep> Prior work on hardware and neural architecture co-design, and closely related work are not addressed <sep> Lacking details on hardware platform and discussion on physical constraints to determine invalid hardware designs (addressed somewhat, but the response is not satisfactory) <sep> One additional comment: if we care about latency for a particular hardware platform, it is possible to automatically configure adaptive inference techniques to meet the latency constraints. <sep> Overall, my assessment is that the paper requires more work before it is ready for publication.
This paper proposes a weighted balanced accuracy metric to evaluate the performance of imbalanced multiclass classification. The metric is based on a one-versus-all decomposition from multi-class to binary, and then aggregating the metrics on the binary classification sub-problems in a weighted manner. The authors hope to argue that the new metric is more flexible for evaluating classifiers in the imbalanced and importance-varying setting. <sep> The reviewers agree that the proposed framework is simple and applicable to an important problem. Somehow the novelty and significance of the work is pretty limited, as many related metrics (e.g. micro/macro-averaged metrics) exist in the literature. The authors are encouraged to think about stronger reasoning on how useful the "new" metric is. The experiments are also not convincing nor complete enough to verify the benefits of the proposed metric.
This paper is a study in optimizing the Donsker-Varadhan lower bound on mutual information focusing on a "drift" problem. The bound is a difference between terms which appears to have an extra degree of freedom where the two terms increase or decrease together. They propose a fix for this problem. The authors state that the DV bound is of practical value but in most cases it is replaced by discriminative lower bounds as in contrastive predictive coding (CPC) which are biased but have lower variance. The paper does not address the variance (convergence) issues with the DV bound. <sep> We have a well informed reviewer who feels that the paper is not sufficiently novel and has other issues supporting rejection. Other reviews are not very enthusiastic. I will side with rejection.
The paper proposes a method for data augmentation by cross-modal data generation. While the reviewers agree that the paper addresses a relevant and important problem in medical imaging, they also agree on that the paper has limited novelty over the state of the art. Also the setup of experimental validation to comparison methods is questioned.
This paper proposes an algorithm to address the disparate effect that DP has on the accuracy of minority/low-frequency sub-populations. Unfortunately the work does not actually guarantee or analyze the resulting privacy guarantees. In particular it may provide much worse privacy (or no privacy at all) to the minority subpopulation. <sep> The paper also calls their algorithm "fair" without using an accepted term or a careful discussion of what an algorithm needs to satisfy to be considered "fair". Using a more technical term such "reducing the accuracy disparity" would make much more sense.
The paper proposes a new distributed training method for graph convolutional networks, using subgraph approximation. The reviewers raised multiple challenges, such as novelty, validity of experiments, and some technical issues. The authors did not respond to the reviewers' comments. The AC agreed with the reviewers that the paper, in the current form, is not ready for publication.
The paper proposes a variant of MAML for meta-learning on tasks with a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on synthetic datasets, and it compares favorably to MAML. The reviewers identified several significant weaknesses, including: (1) the experimental evaluation is limited, and it only includes small synthetic datasets; (2) the proposed algorithm is incremental over MAML. The reviewers agreed that the paper cannot be accepted in its current form. I recommend reject.
It is important to develop efficient training methods for BERT like models since they have been widely used in real-world natural language processing tasks. The proposed approach is interesting. It speeds up BERT training via identifying lottery tickets in the early stage of training. We agree with the authors's rebuttal that autoML is not that related to the work here. Our main concern on this work is its worse-than-BERT performance showed in Table 2. The performance gap is significant. Sufficiently more training steps would fill the performance gap but the proposed method may have no advantage any more over the normal training procedures. To make this work more convincing, we would like to suggest to include experiments on comparing different methods under similar prediction performance. In addition, since the main claim of this work is for training efficiency, it will be helpful to show the advantage of this method by directly presenting the training curves/ results of different methods. Overall this paper is pretty much on the boundary. We encourage the authors to resubmit this work once these issues are well resolved.
This paper introduces an ensemble method to few-shot learning. <sep> Although the introduced method yields competitive results, it is fair to say it is more complicated than much simpler algorithms and does not necessarily perform better. Given that ensembling for few-shot learning has been around for a while, it is not clear that this paper will have a significant audience at *CONF*. <sep> Sorry about the bad news, <sep> AC.
This paper empirically investigates the gradient dynamic of two-layer network nets with ReLU activations on synthetic datasets under L2 loss. The empirical results show that for a specific type of initialization and less overparametrized neural nets, the gradient dynamics experience two phases: a phase that follows the random features model where all the neurons are quenched and another phase where there are a few activated neurons. As pointed out by Reviewer 1, this paper lacks mathematical support and did not distinguish between random features model and neural tangent model. Reviewer 3 and Reviewer 4 also complained that the paper is purely experimental. Therefore, this paper may benefit from proposing an at least heuristic or high-level conjecture/interpretation/argument that tries to explain the empirical results.
The reviewers are unanimous that the submission does not clear the bar for *CONF*.
This paper proposes a suite of benchmark visual model-based RL tasks to evaluate causal discovery approaches under systematically varying causal graphs. Despite some disagreement on this point among reviewers, I would come down on the side of saying that a better-executed version of this paper would have been a good fit at *CONF*. However, its current drawbacks make this a borderline reject. The most important of these drawbacks is: it is unclear to what extent results on these simple environments translate to more realistic complex ones. <sep> Reviewers have also pointed to omitted relevant work that could be discussed in future versions, such as PHYRE. Another relevant benchmark in this vein: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09620
Reviewers liked the concept of the zero-day attack and yet raised different concerns about the other parts of the paper. In general, Reviewers wanted to see more thorough experimental evaluations (e.g., against blackbox attack and adaptive attack) and improved clarity of the theoretical analyses. AC encourages authors to incorporate Reviewers' comments when preparing the paper for elsewhere.
The paper introduces a simple and interesting method that adaptively smoothes the labels of augmented data based on a distance to the "clean" training data. The reviewers have raised concerns about limited novelty, minor improvement over baselines, and insufficient experiments. The author's response was not sufficient to eliminate these concerns. The AC agrees with the reviewers that the paper does not pass the acceptance bar of *CONF*.
This paper proposes a method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by introducing a K+1 abstention class for outliers, in addition to the in-distribution classes. While the method has shown promising performance compared to the Outlier Exposure (OE), the novelty is limited given the idea is almost identical to an AAAI'20 paper (Mohseni et al. 2020). In addition, several reviewers have raised concerns regarding the lack of fairness in the experimental setting. Authors are encouraged to address them in a future submission. <sep> The AC believes an interesting and valuable contribution to the community would be showing conceptual and theoretical reasoning for the pros and cons of using K+1 class vs. entropy regularization. Currently, the tradeoff between these two types of training objectives is not well understood. <sep> Overall, three knowledgeable reviewers in this area have indicated rejections. The AC discounted R2's rating due to the less familiarity in this area and lack of participation in the post-rebuttal discussion among reviewers. <sep> Lastly, the AC would like to greatly thank R1, R3, and R4 for the active engagement and participation in the paper discussion period. It was very helpful for the decision-making process.
There are some interesting ideas raised on continuous-time models with latent variables in machine learning. However, the reviewers argue, and I agree, that the connection to causal models as typically required in applications about the effects of interventions is not addressed with as much care as it might have been needed.
This work analyses the impact of mini-batch size on the variance of the gradients during SGD, in the context of linear models. It shows an inverse relationship between the variance of the gradient and the batch size for such models, under certain assumptions. Reviewers generally agree that the work is theoretically sound. However, all reviewers believe that the contributions of this work are limited. This concern was not adequately addressed during the discussion phase and led to the ultimate decison to reject.
This paper proposes a semi-supervised graph classification technique that unifies feature and label propagation techniques. The resulting algorithm is a simple extension that attains strong performance. Reviewers were divided on this submission. Some reviewers felt the proposed algorithm did not constitute a sufficient technical contribution given that it was a simple combination of existing techniques. I tend to agree with other reviewers that the simplicity is a benefit. However, despite the methods simplicity there was significant confusion about the details of the method and multiple reviewers flagged that the paper was difficult to read and understand. It further could benefit from additional discussion and some clarification/cleanup of the experimental results. Finally, multiple reviewers asked for better situating of the proposed method with respect to prior work. Given these concerns, I do not think the paper is ready for publication. I would recommend the reviewers do a thorough re-write of the paper to address these concerns and consider resubmitting.
Four knowledgeable referees have indicated reject. I agree with the most critical reviewer R4 that the model design lacks a clear and transparent motivation and that the experimental setup is not convincing, and so must reject.
The paper considers using local spectral graph clustering methods such at the PPR-Nibble method for graph neural networks. These local spectral methods are widely used in social networks, and understanding neural networks from them is interesting. <sep> In many ways, the results are interesting and novel, and they deserve to be more widely known, but there are several directions to make the work more useful to the community. These are outlined in the reviewer comments, which the authors answered partially but not completely satisfactorily. Much of this has to do with explaining how/where these (these very fundamental and ubiquitous) methods are useful in a particular application (GNNs here, and node embeddings below). An example of a paper that successfully did this is "LASAGNE: Locality And Structure Aware Graph Node Embedding, E. Faerman, et al. Proc. 2018 Conference on Web Intelligence." (That is mentioned not since it is directly relevant to this paper, but since it provides an example of how to present the use of a method such as PPR-Nibble for the community.
This paper presents an interesting method dubbed quotient manifold modeling to handle the "multi-manifold" structure of natural data and generalize to new manifolds that arise from novel discrete combinations. While some of the methods and ideas were appreciated by reviewers, there were a number of experimental and clarity concerns. The authors's did not submit a rebuttal, and the many unaddressed concerns (especially around experimental baselines) lead me to recommend rejecting this work.
This paper studies two techniques for handling high dimensional action spaces in deep RL, namely selecting action components independently or selecting components sequentially in an autoregressive approach. The methods are developed for two deep RL algorithms (PPO and SAC) and tested on multiple domains. <sep> The reviewers recognized the significance of this research topic but found significant problems in the presentation. The reviewers raised concerns on the relationship to prior work in the literature (R2), baseline comparisons that are missing in the experiments (R2, R4), and a lack of clarity in the intended message of the experiments (R3). The authors responded favorably to the reviews, answered clarification questions, and acknowledged the limitations of the submitted work. The authors expressed their intent to release a stronger paper sometime in the future. The reviewers acknowledged the author response and were in consensus that the submission needs more work. <sep> Three reviewers have indicated reject for the reasons described above. The paper is therefore rejected.
The paper considers a problem of weak mean estimation under a differential privacy like constraint. Specifically, estimating the signs of a (sparse) mean, and not the actual values. <sep> The reviewers brought up a number of concerns, including the weak privacy guarantee (a type of average-case privacy). Other lesser concerns include inaccuracies in comparisons with the literature and lack of interest in the algorithm/method itself. <sep> As there was no response from the authors, there was little further discussion afterwards, and the reviewers remained in their opinion to reject the paper.
This paper provides a new perspective on deep networks by showing that NPK is composed of base kernels and their dependence on the architecture is explicitized. It is further shown that learning the gates can perform better than random gates. <sep> While the paper provides interesting understanding neural networks, it is unclear what practical benefit can be drawn from it. On the architectures considered such as FC, ResNet and CNN (btw, it seems restricted to 1-D), it will be important to show that such insights lead to new models or learning algorithms that improve upon the standard practice in deep learning (or get very close to). It is debatable whether drawing such a nontrivial insight alone warrants publication at *CONF*, while "nontrivial" itself is a subjective judgement. I understand people differ in their opinions, and the NTK paper has been impactful. Unfortunately since there are quite a few other papers that are stronger, I have to recommend not accepting this paper to *CONF* this time.
This paper proposes a method for differentiable pruning that replaces the hard thresholding of standard pruning, with a soft version that permits taking the gradients of the pruning threshold. The proposed benefits are an accuracy that is better or competitive with alternative methods as well. Moreover, the paper suggests the technique to be efficient. <sep> The pros of this paper are that it is working in an interesting setting of differentiable pruning, with the hope of -- in some sense -- simplifying the pruning process or at least unifying the process with standard training. The technique is plausibly justified in its technical development. The paper also follows with a significant number of experiments. <sep> The cons of this paper are that the conceptual framework -- beyond the initial idea -- is not fully clear. In particular, this paper does not elucidate a clear set of claims and hence, results in the difficulty on the Reviewers part in detangling the claims and identifying the appropriate comparisons. <sep> For example, the paper doesn't take up a simple claim that it is state-of-the-art in accuracy vs parameter measures (and would seem not to given the results of Renda et al. (2020)). It need not necessarily make this claim, but there are suggestions to such a claim early in the paper. If this is not an intended claim, then the paper can remove any suggestions to such (i.e., the claims around new SoTA for networks not evaluated in prior work). <sep> The paper has a somewhat tentative claim that it is more efficient (in the total number of epochs of training) versus other techniques (Table 3). However, the presented results are only at a single-point versus other methods. Renda et al. (2020) directly consider accuracy versus retraining cost trade-offs. Appendix E of that paper provides one-shot pruning results for ResNet-50 showing accuracy on par with that presented here. The number of retraining epochs is also similar to here. This paper, however, only compares against the most expensive iterative pruning data point in the other paper. <sep> In sum, my recommendation is Reject. This is promising work that needs only (1) to include a few testable claims and (2) to re-organize the results (and perhaps run a limited set of new results) to thoroughly explore those claims. For example, if the most important claim is accuracy vs retraining cost, then it needs to show a more complete trade-off curve of the two results. Of course, this, in principle, opens the door to comparisons to many other techniques in the literature.
The paper analyzes the space of mixed sample data augmentation approaches, and proposes a new variant, FMix, based on a new masking strategy. Reviewers point to the fact that FMix is only marginally better than previous approaches, that the experimental setup is unconvincing, and that the proposed analysis might not be grounded. This is a really borderline paper but I see the issues as more important than the benefits, so I recommend rejection.
Though the observation regarding the importance of the low end of the spectrum is interesting in its own right, the paper would be better substantiated by experiments on more datasets and a more thorough characterization of the paper novelty/contrast to state of the art.
This paper provides approximation results for functions that can be represented by hybrid quantum-classical circuits. It is felt that venues such as QIP would be a more suitable venue, and perhaps some experiments/simulations could be added.
The reviewers positively valued the proposed idea of performing permutation selection in permutation decoding via combining node embedding and self-attention, which seems to be of high originality. I found that this paper is mostly clearly written, except Section 3.2 as AnonReviewer5 commented. The main concern among the reviewers is regarding applicability of the proposal beyond the BCH codes. <sep> Pros: <sep> The proposal of utilizing self-attention for permutation selection in permutation decoding is novel and interesting. <sep> Computational complexity in the decoding phase is only slightly increased compared with random permutation selection, and is far smaller than performing decoding for all permutations. The GPS classifier can be parallelizable to further reduce latency. <sep> The proposal should be applicable beyond the BCH codes to those with decoding based on the Tanner graph, including polar codes. <sep> Cons: <sep> Only the BCH codes were considered, whereas in the authors responses they will add a short analysis on polar codes. <sep> It seems that systematic enumeration of the PG is required, which would limit applicability of the proposal. <sep> There is a room for improvement in presentation: <sep> In Section 3.2, the description of "positional encodings" was unclear to me, in that the ordering of the codeword entries is arbitrary, unlike typical sequence transduction problems to which attention mechanism is being applied. <sep> Dependence of the input vector sequences of the attention head on the permutation π is not clearly explained. <sep> Performance of the proposed method might depends on choices of the parity-check matrix, which is however not discussed in this paper at all. <sep> Based on the above concerns, the paper is not yet ready for publication in its current form. <sep> Minor points: <sep> In page 3, line 14, "that" should be deleted. <sep> In references list, "hdpc" should be in capital. "reed-muller" should be "Reed-Muller".
The paper proposes hybrid discriminative + generative training of energy-based models (HDGE) building on JEM. By connecting contrastive loss functions to generative loss, HDGE proposes an alternative loss function that reduces computational cost of training EBMs. <sep> The reviewers agree that this is an interesting idea and that the empirical results look promising. <sep> However, multiple reviewers raised concerns that the theoretical justification was incomplete and felt that some of the claims about the equivalence between the two, as well as some of the practical approximations introduced, need more justification. <sep> I encourage the authors to revise the paper and resubmit to a different venue.
Four reviewers evaluated your work and provided a detailed review with many suggestions. I also think that there is an interesting idea and encouraging results but there is a lack of numerical results and still some parts are still unclear and need to be polished. Consequently in its current form, the paper can not be accepted for publication. I would advise you to carefully follow the remarks of reviewer 1 to improve the paper.
The work studies the transferability of perturbations/adversarial attacks on DRL agents. As a way to mitigate the cost of generating individual perturbation for each state in each episode, the authors proposed several variants to use same perturbation across different states across different episodes. While reviewers recognize the potential of the direction, they are not comfortable accepting the paper at its current state. The experiment results in its current form does not provide enough support to the claim. In particular, it is unclear how much the shared perturbation changes the original perception in comparison to the individual comparison, and how should the impact number differences be interpreted. Reviewers brought up concerns regarding all the experiments being evaluated on a DDQN agent, and not enough clarities has been provided on the different design choices. If perceptual similarity is not the indicator of environment transferability, do the authors have intuition on what does?
the paper undoubtedly tackles an interesting problem in the mainstream of learning with partial / unknown / weak / noisy / complementary labels. The authors have had a set of constructive suggestions and questions from the reviewers (and external comments), some positive, some negative. I find it a bit unsettling that to several major questions, the main feedback from the authors was a citation in the paper with no further action; (a) ablation tests of R2 end up in citing papers from a public comment, (b) R4 raised a key point in comment 2, with the links to partial labels learning. The authors' answer is not satisfying as one would have hoped at least of a partial justification of the author's approach in this context. The authors would have had time to develop at least elements of a formal comparison. Just citing the work is not enough;
This paper studies RL with low switching cost under the deep RL setting. It provides new heuristics for doing so. The reviewers are worrying about whether the problem is important in practice, whether the policies obtained can be used in practice, and the theories might not be strong enough. The paper can be strengthened if better theory and more experiments are provided.
This paper considers a new model of input data specific for image classification problems. In particular, the high level idea is that each image contains certain patterns, and which patterns it contain decides its label. In this framework, under some stronger assumptions (e.g., patterns are orthogonal, one positive pattern and one negative pattern, PSI assumption, etc.) the authors showed that SGD on a 3-layer overparametrized convolutional network will be able to have a small sample complexity, while the VC dimension would be at least exponential in d. The paper also provided some empirical evidence on a modified MNIST dataset. While the idea seems to be an interesting first step, the reviewers find that the current version of theory still relies on fairly strong assumptions.
This paper investigates how to deploy adaptive learning rates in multi-agent RL (MARL). In particular, the learning rates are adaptively chosen based on which directions maximally affect the Q-function, and take into account the interplay and balance between the actors and the critics. The topic is certainly of great interest when designing fast-convergent MARL algorithms. However, the reviewers point out the inadequacy and insufficiency of empirical gains in the reported experiments. Also, larger-scale experimental settings are needed in order to provide more convincing evidence about the practical benefits of the proposed scheme.
This work presents a distributed SVGD (DSVGD) algorithm as a new non-parametric Bayesian framework for federated learning. The reviewers concerned with the practical advantages of the proposed method, including the communication cost and the constraint of updating one agent per time. The authors rebuttal helped addressing some of the concerns, including proposing a new Parallel-DSVGD algorithm. This is very much appreciated. However, given the significant modification needed over the original version, we think it is better for the authors to further improve the work and submit to the next conference.
The submitted paper is well written and easy to follow and also the idea of using VAEs for making inferences about the opponents on which a policy can be conditioned on is sensible. Also the reported performance in comparison to two baselines is good (although I have concerns about the selection of the baselines—see below). Acceptance of the paper was suggested by 3 of the reviewers and rejection by one of the reviewers. While I don't share all concerns of the negative reviewer, I also suggest to reject the paper. <sep> My suggestion to reject the paper is mainly based on seeing concerns of the positive reviewers more critical as these reviewers themselves and some concerns I have on my own. In particular, I don't think that all MARL approaches can simply be discarded for comparison—no matter whether the opponents are learning or not. Regarding the evaluation, I think that an environment with real opponents must be considered and that robustness is a key property that should be studied (otherwise an approach with a fixed set of best response policies and inference about the opponent might perform as well). In that regard I also find the selection of baselines insufficient—the minimum I would expect is to consider a NOM baseline using an RNN (which as far as I can tell is not the case) such that it could make inferences about the opponent. <sep> I want to acknowledge that the paper improved quite a lot during the rebuttal period in which the authors extended their discussion of related work on opponent modeling. <sep> In summary, the paper could be improved substantially by an extended empirically study (more environments + baselines + "mismatch" settings). If the currently observed performance gains also hold in these settings, this can become a good paper but in its current form I think the paper is not demonstrating that the proposed approach performs favorably over natural baselines and works well against real opponents.
Summary of discussions: R1 was positive on the paper in their initial evaluation, and although dissatisfied with the author's feedback, continued to support the paper. I agree with R1's assessment that other reviewers' call for more theory is somewhat unfair, considering the fact that very similar papers don't usually include theoretical justification beyond intuitive motivation. <sep> By contrast, R3 is the most negative on the paper, leaning towards rejection. The main concern is that open questions remain as to whether the reported performance can be attributed to the architecture, or the loss function proposed. This is an important point to clarify, and further ablation studies would make the paper stronger. <sep> After considering the strengths and weaknesses of this work, the final decision was to reject. Authors are encouraged to improve this promising work and resubmit to a future venue.
The paper proposes an intriguing approach for "individual treatment effect" estimation from an observational dataset. The approach is developed for multiple discrete actions (beyond binary treatments as typically studied in ITE literature) and discrete outcomes (a special case compared to related literature). The idea is to use the "direct method" (i.e. learn a probabilistic classifier using the observed dataset) and sample imputed outcomes for all unobserved action-outcomes. Then, learn a probabilistic classifier that fits the observed+imputed dataset well, and iterate the procedure. This intriguing idea seems to converge empirically on a few different problems, and sampling the imputations rather than using deterministic imputations seems to be an important detail. <sep> Proof of convergence is however shown for deterministic imputations. The generalization error bound (Theorem 1) also does not show adequate motivation for the proposed method -- even with infinite data (n->infinity), the excess risk could scale with the empirical risk of the returned model on the imputed dataset. Without an additional step proving that empirical risk on hat{D} (the imputed dataset) converges to 0 during successive iterations of the procedure, the generalization error bound is incomplete. <sep> Consider the example of Figure 1, but where customer A has arrived to the system twice. So, the dataset contains {x1, $2, 1} and {x1, $3, 0}. When constructing the imputed dataset, the first data-point would create 2 regression examples {x1, $1, ..} and {x1, $3, ..} while the second data-point would create 2 regression examples {x1, $1, ..} and {x1, $2, ..}. <sep> Now, if the two {x1, $1, ..} examples have different imputation labels sampled from the model, this sets up an unrealizable learning problem and the empirical risk on hat{D} cannot be 0 for any predictor. <sep> In this toy example, we might know that we should "collapse" the two data-points (e.g., de-duplicate the dataset to only have unique x's with aggregated action-outcomes across all observations) in the original data-set and only create one set of imputed labels -- but similar unrealizability can happen for x's that are "close" to each other that no model has capacity to label them differently. <sep> The strength of the paper is its intriguing approach to ITE estimation. It is a form of an iterative S-learner (vanilla S-learners have been widely used in ITE estimation). <sep> The low-point of the paper is this weakness in theory and analysis -- it is unclear if the proposed procedure with sampling imputations (which seems to be important for empirical performance) is even a consistent algorithm. <sep> The paper would be much stronger with a more rigorous analysis of when the method will reliably work, and importantly, its limitations -- such a study will help practitioners know when to use self-training over direct method, targeted max likelihood, S-learners, etc.
The authors study "robustness curves" which are plots of the robust error versus the radius used in the corresponding l_p-ball threat model. <sep> Pro: I completely agree with the authors that the current evaluation purely based on evaluation for a single radius is insufficient <sep> and one should report the complete curve. <sep> Con: The authors are overclaiming that they have come up with robustness curves. Very early papers e.g. even in the adversarial <sep> training paper of Madry there are plots of robust accuracy versus chosen threshold. Moreover, I agree with one of the reviewers that using PGD for the purpose of a robustness curve is inaccurate and in particular inefficient as several attacks for different radii have to be done. There have been several attacks developed which aim to find the adversarial sample with minimum norm and thus compute the robustness curve in one run. <sep> The additional insights e.g. intersection of robustness curves are partially to be expected and I don't find them sufficient to move the paper over the bar for *CONF*. As these insights are additionally only shown for relatively small models which seem far away from the state of the art, it is unclear if they generalize. However, I encourage to follow some of the reviewer's suggestions to improve the paper.
This promising work proves that the proposed contrastive learning approach to representation learning can recover the underlying topic posterior information given standard topic modelling assumptions. The work provides detailed proof and detailed experiments. The analysis is interesting and yields interesting insights. However, the experimental results are somewhat weak by lacking comparison with more recent document representation work. <sep> Pros: <sep> Good detailed proofs and experiments. <sep> Interesting idea of using topic modelling to understand representation learning. <sep> Cons: <sep> The description of DirectNCE is somewhat hidden and could be better introduced in the paper. <sep> Experimental baselines are weak lacking a comparison to recent document representation work such as Arora et al. 2019. <sep> Stronger classification baselines could be incorporated.
This paper addresses the real-world problem of semi-supervised learning where the distribution from which the labeled examples are drawn is different from the distribution from which the unlabeled examples are drawn. The task is motivated by structure-activity prediction for drug design (quantitative structure activity prediction, or QSAR). Examples represent molecules, and we wish to predict a real-valued measure of binding affinity. Exactly the general problem of data skew arose with exactly this task for example in one of the KDD Cup 2001 tasks. While the authors here mention that labeled data may be focused more on active molecules (those with a high continuous-valued response), in the KDD Cup 200`1 data the reverse was true, and the unlabeled test data were skewed to higher activity level. I say all this to agree with the authors about the real-world nature of the problem they address. Also, some reviewers felt more empirical evaluation was needed, so that may be an additional data set for the authors to consider using. <sep> Reviewer concerns including that the approach was simplistic, the empirical results were insufficient, and the claims were oversold. The author replies and revisions, and the discussion, moved the reviews to be more favorable but still not strong enough to justify acceptance yet. Nevertheless, the consensus is that the paper addresses an important problem and the revisions are headed in the right direction to make a strong future paper, and that the authors should be encouraged to continue this work.
The paper received 5 reviews, one of which had positive feedback. Although there are merits associated with the paper, several concerns raised in the reviews and the discussion period that prevents the paper to be accepted. It appears that experiments on noisy graphs are not properly done and competitive baselines are not used for validations. The quality of the learned graph structure is not adequately analyzed. and the experimental setup was not clearly explained. All these indicate that there is a need for a major revision before the paper can be considered for acceptance.
This work was deemed interesting by the reviewers, but they highlighted the following weaknesses in this version of the paper: <sep> Lack of comparison to other methods. <sep> Lack of novelty compared to previous work. <sep> Fundamental problem with training only on one dataset (MNIST), issue with possible overfitting.
The paper proposed a two-stage method to select instances from a set, involving candidate selection (learning a function to determine a Bernoulli probability for each input) and AutoRegressive subset selection (learning a function to generate probabilities for sampling elements from a reduced set); both stages use the Concrete distribution to ensure differentiability. The experiments show the performance of the proposed method on several use-cases, including reconstruction of an image from a subset of its pixels, selecting sparse features for a classification task, and dataset distillation for few-shot classification. I read the paper and I agree with the reviewers that in its current format the paper is hard to follow. I strongly encourage the authors to add more discussion and intuition on the proposed method and extend the experiments with more baseline comparison and ablation studies in the revised version.
The paper proposes a fast, nearly-linear time, algorithm for finding a sparsifier for general directed and undirected graphs that approximately preserves the spectral properties of the original graph. The reviewers appreciated the main contribution of the paper, but they were concerned about the correctness and clarity of the paper, as well as the relevance of the contribution to machine learning. Following the discussion with the authors, the reviewers still felt that these concerns had not been fully addressed by the authors' responses and the subsequent revision of the paper. After taking these concerns into account as well as evaluating the paper relative to other *CONF* submissions, I recommend reject.
In this paper the authors propose an approach to improving the accuracy of the classification problem based on deep neural networks by detecting the in-domain data from background/noise. The strategy is designed in such a way that the detector and the classifier share the bottom layers of the network. Theoretical proof is given and experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets. The novelty of the work is to come up with a better estimate the pdf of the data and use it to help the classification based on the deep neural networks. There are concerns raised by the reviewers regarding the related work, the exposition and the experimental design. After the rebuttal from the authors, which is meticulous, some of the issues unfortunately still stand. The paper needs to make a stronger case in order to be accepted, especially, for instance, the theoretical and empirical comparison with the existing techniques sharing the similar idea.
This work proposes a method to discover neighboring local optima around an existing one. Reviewers all found the idea interesting but argued that the paper needed more work. In particular, some of the claims are too informal or not sufficiently supported and the reviewers found the key section were difficult to follow. The paper should be resubmitted after improving the presentation of the results.
This paper proposes OpenCos for semi-supervised learning that can leverage unsupervised information in open-set scenarios where samples can be out-of-class. They first pre-train by learning an unsupervised representation using SimCLR on both the labeled and unlabeled data. Then, they detect out-of-class samples in the unlabeled set based on similarity measures on the representation learned in the previous step. The unlabeled data can now be split into in-class and out-of-class. OpenCos optimizes (8) which combines a semi-supervised loss for in-class unlabeled data and an auxiliary cross-entropy loss with soft-labels for the out-of-class samples. Finally, they perform an auxiliary batch normalization. <sep> The paper is easy to read and clearly structured. It also places the work well with respect to related work. <sep> The proposed approach makes sense; however, as pointed out by the reviewers, the novelty is marginal. The technical innovation seems to be an extension of SimCLR and the auxiliary batch norm of Xie et al.
While the reviewers appreciated the aim of the work, they found the technical contribution to be too incremental to be of sufficient interest and the exploration of the problem and its significance to be incomplete in the paper's current state.
The authors study the problem of (insufficient) generalization in gossip-type decentralized deep learning. Specifically, they establish an upper bound on the square of the consensus parameter distance, which the authors identify as a key quantity that influences both optimization and generalization. This upper bound (called the critical consensus distance) can be monitored and controlled during the training process via (e.g.) learning rate scheduling and tweaking the amount of gossip. A series of empirical results on decentralized image classification and neural machine translation are presented in support of this observation. <sep> Initial reviews were mixed. While all reviewers liked the approach, concerns were raised about the novelty of the results, the lack of theoretical depth, and the mismatch between theory and experiments. Overall, the idea of tracking consensus distance to control generalization seems to be a practically useful concept. During the discussion phase the authors were been able to (convincingly, in the area chair's view) respond to a subset of the criticisms. <sep> Unfortunately, concerns remained regarding the mismatch between the theoretical and empirical results, and in the end the paper fell just short of making the cut. <sep> The authors are encouraged to carefully consider the reviewers' concerns while preparing a future revision.
The authors present a method for self-supervised learning of representations of 2D projections of 3D objects. By performing known 3D transformations of an object of interest, a encoder/decoder network is trained to estimate the applied transformation from a series of 2D projections. The proposed method is used as a regularizer and experiments are performed on supervised 3D object classification and retrieval. <sep> After seeing each others' reviews, one of the main concerns from the reviewers was the relationship between the proposed method and Zhang et al., CVPR 2019 (i.e. AET). The two methods are conceptually very similar, and the consensus from the reviewers is that the authors did not acknowledge the overlap sufficiently and also did not provide a convincing argument as to why they think the approaches are different. <sep> In their rebuttal the authors provided some additional results on real data which is a valuable and welcome addition. However, there were still other concerns that the reviewers had e.g. R2 wanted to know why the model could not be applied directly to 3D shapes instead of 2D projections. <sep> Given the above concerns (specifically the relationship to AET), there is currently not enough support for accepting the paper in its current form. The authors have received detailed feedback and are encouraged to take it onboard when revising the paper in future.
Like the reviewers, I find this paper extremely borderline. On the one hand, it is clearly written, about a topic I find fascinating, and generally well motivated if not shockingly novel (i.e. removing some of the simplifying assumptions from Zhong et al. 2020, e.g. requiring grounding to be learned, use of real language rather than synthetically generated). On the other hand, I agree with the leitmotiv present amongst the reviews that the problem at the centre of the experimental setting is very, very simple (3 objects, 3 descriptions). I am mindful of the fact that access to computational resources is unevenly distributed, and am not expecting a paper like this to immediately scale their experiments to highly complex settings with photorealism, etc, but I can't help but feel that a more challenging task, with a deeper analysis of the problems presented by both grounding and the use of non-synthetic language, would both have been highly desirable to make this paper uncontroversially worth accepting. <sep> As a result, the decision is to not accept the paper in its present form. Work on this topic should definitely be presented at *CONF*, but it's a shame this paper did not make a stronger case for itself.
This paper proposes an interesting new direction for low-cost NAS. However, the paper is not quite ready for acceptance in its current form. The main area of improvement is around the generalizability of the score presented, both empirically and (ideally) theoretically. The two main directions of generalizability that would be worth investigating are 1) different image datasets (see comments around Imagenet-16) 2) different/larger search spaces. Even simple search spaces consisting of a few architectural modification starting from standard architectures (e.g. resnets) would go a long way in convincing the community that the proposed method generalizes past NasBench.
The paper studies personalized federated learning, mixing a global model with locally trained models. Reviewers agreed on the relevance of the problem and that the work contains valuable contributions, such as the generalization bounds. <sep> After discussion, unfortunately consensus remained that the paper remains narrowly below the bar in the current form. <sep> Concerns remained on novelty over the Mapper optimization algorithm which also has adaptivity to the local/global combination of models, the dependence of the generalization bound on the mixing parameter as it converges to the global model, <sep> as well as on the strength of the experimental findings compared to well-known FedAvg and related method in a realistic benchmark environment (such as e.g. Leaf), since the dataset choice (and even more its partition among clients) is a crucial aspect for measuring personalization in a fair way. We hope the feedback helps to strengthen the paper for a future occasion.
This paper is about training a discrete policy that maps an image representation through a differentiable time-dependent path planning module. The method is based on [1] and the reviewers are concerned about lack of novelty with respect to this work, and also with [2], however the latter only appeared a few weeks before the *CONF* deadline, so I am not factoring it in my recommendation. Unfortunately, in light of [1], 3/4 reviewers do not recommend acceptance, and I agree with them. <sep> [1] Vlastelica, Paulus, Musil, Martius, Rolinek.

I found the main algorithmic contributions to be interesting and of potential value to practitioners, as highlighted by Reviewer 3. Like several reviewers, I found the causal framing to be confusing, or at least not really to be framed in a framework like Pearl's: the word "confounding" is thrown a few times in the manuscript, but there is no formal sense by which it is linked to what we commonly understand as confounding. We are still talking about what happens inside a predictive model (a deterministic function), not what happens in the real world (the authors are not alone as targets of my observation: my point applies to a lot of the papers in the references, where the causal interpretation is hardly illuminating for those coming from a causal inference background, for instance). The reply to Reviewer 2, for instance, cites [1], which is about Granger causality and has little to do with Pearl's framework. Despite its name, Granger "causality" is a probabilistic concept (or, at best, an idea for identifying non-causality) with a very minimal causal basis besides the use of time ordering. A much more rigorous explanation of confounding in this paper's context needs to be provided. <sep> That been said: as helpfully highlighted by Reviewer 3 (and summarized without any need to resort to a causal framing), there are several positive contributions added here, which might be of interest to the *CONF* audience. The causal framing unfortunately gets in the way without adding clarity. <sep> In its present state, the paper is not yet ready for publication. We hope that the reviewer comments prove helpful for preparing a strong future submission.
This paper tackles a problem of resource allocation using reinforcement learning. An important invariant - permutation invariant - is identified as an important characteristic of this problem. Then it is shown that taking advantage of such an invariant should dramatically improve the sample efficiency. <sep> On behalf of the reviewers, I would like to thank the authors for addressing many concerns raised in the initial reviews. Unfortunately, a further examination revealed several other potential issues that require further clarification: <sep> It seems that real-data experiments do not really demonstrate whether the benefits of the approach come from multi-task learning or from permutation invariance. It would make sense to run an ablation study. In particular, if the benefit is really coming from multi-task learning, then the theory part of the paper becomes less relevant. <sep> The metric used for finance application appear to be in-adequate. It is typical in finance academic literature to look some form of risk-adjusted returns. Is the MTL strategy just taking more risk? How statistically significant are the results? <sep> Given these concerns the paper can not be accepted in its current form but we encourage authors to address these and resubmit.
This paper investigates an improvement to the direct feedback alignment (DFA) algorithm where the "backward weights" are learned instead of being fixed random matrices. The proposed approach essentially applies the technique of DFA to Kolen-Pollack learning. While reviewers found the paper reasonably clear and thought the experiments were acceptable, there were significant concerns about the novelty of the approach and the fact that the proposed approach was a straightforward combination of existing ideas. Further, the paper could have done a better job situating (and applying) the proposed method to DFA variants that have been proposed since the original DFA paper came out.
This is a borderline case (quite comparable to the other borderline case in my batch). The paper has received careful reviews and based on my weighting of the different arguments I arrive at an average score between 5.75 and 6.. The authors present some worthwhile ideas related to disentanglement that deserves more attention and that could spark more research in this direction. At the same time, the level of novelty and significance of this work remains a bit limited. Taken together the paper is likely not compelling enough to be among the top papers to be selected for publication at *CONF*.
The paper introduces a new formulation for learning low-dimensional manifold representations via autoencoder mappings that are (locally) isometric by design. The key technical ingredient is the use of a particular (theoretically motivated) weight-tied architecture coupled with isometry-promoting loss terms that can be approximated via Monte Carlo sampling. Representative results on simple manifold learning experiments are shown in support of the proposed formulation. <sep> The paper was generally well-received; all reviewers appreciated the theoretical elements as well as the presentation of the ideas. <sep> However, there were a few criticisms. First, the fact that the approach requires Monte Carlo sampling in very high dimensions automatically limits its scope. Second, the experiments seemed somewhat limited to simple (by *CONF* standards) datasets. Third and most crucially, the approach lacks a compelling-enough use case. It is not entirely clear what local isometry enables, beyond nice qualitative visualizations (and moreover, what the isometric autoencoder provides over other isometry-preserving manifold learning procedures such as ISOMAP). Some rudimentary results are shown on k-NN classification and linear SVMs, but the gains seem to be in the margins. <sep> The authors are encouraged to consider the above concerns (and in particular, identifying a unique use case for isometric autoencoders) while preparing a future revision.
The paper makes an attempt towards byzantine resilient federated learning, in the pressneece of backdoor attacks. <sep> The method presented combines a clustering step with a poison elimination step, and seems to be effective against a range of current attacks. <sep> Both steps are a bit ad hoc in nature, and do not come with provable guarantees. <sep> Moreover, the algorithms presented will have a big negative impact on personalization as several models may be incorrectly discarded during and FL round. <sep> The authors further point in their response that " no existing defense against backdoor attacks preserves the privacy of the clients' data." This is in fact not true, as the differential privacy defense presented by the "Can you really backdoor FL" paper is in fact fully respective of user privacy. <sep> At the same time, the work on backdoor attacks and defenses is reminiscent of the "cat and mouse" work in adversarial examples: an attack comes out, then a defense claims to protect against it, then an attack that incorporates that defense can be made stronger, and so on. This is similar in the context of backdoor attacks. <sep> In fact, a recent work [1] proposes that detecting backdoors is in the general computationally unlikely, rendering the generality of the proposed algorithm questionable, and also suggest a set of attacks that seem very hard to defend against. (it is fine that the authors do not reference this work as it was published just recently) <sep> As the paper lacks significant algorithmic novelty, solid guarantees, and also is unclear whether it is universally sound, the overall contribution is limited. <sep> [1] Wang et al.

The reviewers agree that this paper has some interesting ideas. However, they believe it needs more work before it is ready for publication, especially so with regards to presentation (SDEs as GANs) and the experiments (backpropagating through the solver rather than using the adjoint dynamics). These would significantly strengthen the paper, but would probably require another round of reviews.
The paper presents a hierarchical version of NMF for the CP decomposition of tensors. <sep> The idea is similar to Chinocki etal 2007 and extends Gao etal 2019, and in Chinocki was presented for the standard linear formulation with regularisation terms. The extension here doesn't use the standard ALS algorithm but rather presents a neural network analogue, though the functions are still linear, its just that back-prop etc. are used for the computation. The authors point out their formulation is a more flexible representation and optimisation (in response to AnonReviewer5), and thus represents an improvement. While this is an interesting implementation, in NNs, the model is still fairly simple. <sep> Moreover the experimental results are restricted to a few data sets. There are literally hundreds of NMF variants in publication and many different evaluations are done. The experimental work here, while showcasing the work, is not extensive. For instance, more empirical comparisons should have been made against prior hierarchical NMF on a battery of data. <sep> So this is good, publishable work, and the authors have repaired many of the issues raised by the reviewers. The work, however, is borderline in empirical work and the contribution is not strong.
This work studies the question of universal approximation with neural networks under general symmetries. For this purpose, the authors first leverage existing universal approximation results with shallow fully connected networks defined on infinite-dimensional input spaces, that are then upgraded to provide Universal Approximation of group-equivariant functions using group equivariant convolutional networks. <sep> Reviewers were all appreciative of the scope of this paper, aimed at unifying different UAT results under the same underlying 'master theorem', bringing a much more general perspective on the problem of learning under symmetry. However, reviewers also expressed concerns about the accessibility and readibility of the current manuscript, pointing at the lack of examples and connections with existing models/results. Authors did a commendable job at adding these examples and incorporating reviewers feedback into a much improved revision. <sep> After taking all the feedback into account, this AC has the uncomfortable job of recommending rejection at this time. Ultimately, the reason is that this AC is convinced that this paper can be made even better by doing an extra revision that helps the reader navigate through the levels of generality. As it turns out, this paper was reviewed by three top senior experts at the interface of ML and groups/invariances, who themselves found that the treatment could be made more accessible --- thus hinting a difficult read for non-experts. In particular, the main result of this work (theorem 9) is based on a rather intuitive idea (that one can leverage UAT for generic neural nets on the generator of an equivariant function), that requires some technical 'care' in order to be fleshed out. The essence of the proof can be conveyed in simple terms, after which following through the proof is much easier. Similarly, the paper quickly adopts an abstract (yet precise) formalism in terms of infinite-dimensional domains, which again clouds the essential ideas in technical details. While the paper now contains several examples, this AC believes the authors can go to the extra mile of connecting them together, and further discussing the shortcomings of the result --- in particular, the remarks on tensor representations and the invariant case are of great importance in practice, and should be discussed more prominently. Finally, while this work is only concerned with universal approximation, an important aspect that is not mentioned here is the quantitative counterpart, ie what are the approximation rates for symmetric functions under the considered models.
The paper proposes a novel way to have weight decay-like update rule. Empirically, the authors claim that it improves generalization when applied to momentum-based optimizers and optimizers with coordinate-wise learning rates. <sep> This paper has been thoroughly discussed, both in public and private mode. <sep> The strength of this paper lies in the possible gain in generalization performance due the proposed change. <sep> The weaknesses are: <sep> the very confusing and not scientific motivation of the proposed change <sep> the experiments are not fully convincing <sep> More in details, we all found the discussion on "stable" and "unstable" weight decay extremely confusing. The claim of the paper is that "stable" weight decay should be preferred over "unstable" one. However, to validate a scientific claim it is necessary to carry out an empirical or theoretical evaluation. The theoretical one is simply missing: a number of proposition and corollaries are stated with some simple mathematical facts completely disconnected from the optimization or generalization issues. As it is, removing these arguments would actually make the paper better. <sep> On the empirical side, there is no experiment that supports the simple claim that "the unstable weight decay problem may undesirably damage performance". Instead, what we see are experiments in which the modified update rule seem to perform better, but they don't actually show that "stability" or "instability" are the specific issues at play here. Indeed, any other explanation is equally valid and the experiments do not support any specific one, but rather they can only support the claim that the proposed algorithm might be better than some other optimization algorithms. The specific reason why this is happening is not clear. <sep> Turning to the empirical evaluation, the discussion elicited the fact that, a part for CIFAR10, the experiments are carried out without tuning of the learning rates. Hence, it is difficult for us to even validate the claim of superiority of the method. I don't subscribe to the idea that a deep learning paper requires experiments on ImageNet to be valid. Yet, given that there is no supporting theory in this paper, the empirical evaluation should be solid and thorough. <sep> For the above reasons, the paper cannot be published at *CONF*.
This paper proposes a method for predicting higher-order structure in time-varying graphs. The paper was reviewed by three expert reviewers, and while they expressed appreciation for the sensible solution, they have remaining concerns about the novel contributions and comparisons (analytical and empirical) with previous approaches. Also, the paper would be clearer if examples are used to illustrate the important points of the paper. The authors are encouraged to continue research, taking into consideration the detailed comments provided by the reviewers.
While the submission has promising components, the reviewers were not able to reach a consensus to recommend acceptance. The main concerns is that (1) theorem statements and assumptions are not clearly explained, and (2) the novelty of the approach is not made clear, and (3) there remain concerns on whether the experimental results are due to hyperparameter search or improvements due to the model.
The authors investigate different tokenization methods for the translation between French and Fon (an African low-resource language). Low-resource machine translation is a very important topic and it is great to see work on African languages - we need more of this! <sep> Unfortunately, the reviewers unanimously agree that this work might be better suited for a different conference, for example LREC, since the machine learning contributions are small. The AC encourages the authors to consider submitting this work to LREC or a similar conference.
The paper proposed a useful incremental extension to the monotonic GMM attention by incorporating source content. <sep> It has shown comparable performance for online and long-form speech recognition, but falls behind on the machine translation task. For online ASR, it would be more convincing to include latency comparisons across different streaming models besides WERs. <sep> The presentation of the paper can be further improved although it already got better based on reviewers' comments. <sep> As in the discussion, a more accurate description of the method would be "multi-head Gaussian attention" instead of GMM attention. <sep> The main factor for the decision is limited novelty and clarity can be further improved.
This paper proposes a method for neural architecture search (NAS) based on adversarial methods. It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator. I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea. Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, e.g. it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board. Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates. <sep> The major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines. This criticism remained despite the authors' responses. The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2. (I would recommend, for example, moving Fig. 2 to the main text if at all possible. Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for *CONF*, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.) It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit. The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations. If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free. Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers. <sep> As a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for *CONF*: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review. Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions. <sep> I appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews. However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript. The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.
There are two main contributions in this paper. First, the use of NN from the same cluster as "views" of the data as understood in classical contrastive learning. Second, the use of additional augmentation techniques, namely cutMix and multi-resolution. The reviewers noted that the paper is written well and easy to understand, that the ablation study is conducted well and that the model shows good empirical performance on several tasks. <sep> At the same time, the somewhat limited novelty of the paper was also discussed. As noted by R4, all aspects of the present paper have been discussed in previous work. The difference with previously published clustering-based SSL methods was also not very clear. This was discussed in the rebuttal but without strong evidence supporting the claims. Moreover, the ablation study is conducted on models that are trained for 200 epochs. While this is understandable from a pragmatic point of view, the conclusions may be completely different when the model is fully optimised. <sep> Because of all the points raised in the discussions, this paper is a too close to borderline to be accepted. We recommend the authors improve the manuscript given the feedback provided in the reviews and discussion and resubmit to another venue.
The authors propose a new approach to topology optimization to address over-smoothing in GCNs. This is a borderline paper. Topology optimization is clearly important and relevant and the approach tries to optimize the topology (add/delete edges) by viewing the problem as a latent variable model and aiming to optimize the graph together with the GCN parameters to maximize the likelihood of observed node labels. A number of related joint topology optimization approaches exist, however, as discussed in the reviews and the responses. The proposed methodology is termed variational EM but is a bit heuristic in the sense that E and M steps do not follow a consistent criterion (the direction of KL is flipped between the steps). A number of comparisons are provided with consistent gains though the gains appear relatively small. No error bars are provided despite request to add them to better assess the significance of these results. It remains unclear whether the gains are worth the added complexity.
This paper shows that linear layers can be replaced by butterfly networks. Put simple, the paper follows the idea of sketching to design new architectures that can reduce the number of trainable parameters and also gives the theoretical and empirical analysis to validate this claim. In this regard, the paper would be appealing. But the theoretical results given in this paper are incremental.
The authors propose a pretraining strategy learning inductive biases in transformers for deduction, induction, and abduction. Further, the claims and results seem to indicate that such pretraining is more successful in transformers which provide a more malleable architecture for learning inductive (structural) biases. There are open questions that remain, specifically surrounding disentangling high performance from structural bias learning (i.e. is pretraining doing what we think it is) and whether datasets are the "correct" mechanism for imparting such biases/knowledge.
The paper proposes a unification of three popular baseline regularizers in continual learning. The unification is realized through a claim that they all regularize (surprisingly) related objectives. <sep> The key strengths of the paper highlighted by the reviewers were: <sep> The established connection is valuable and interesting, even if weaker than suggested originally <sep> Good motivation (unifying different regularization methods is useful for the community) <sep> Clear writing <sep> The key weakness of the paper is a weak empirical validation of the claim that these three regularizers work because they regularize the norm of the gradient (as mentioned in the discussion by R3). Rather, the key claims are correlational. The authors correctly say that (1) the three regularizers all regularize related objects (namely different norms of the gradient) and (2) they reduce forgetting. However, it is not sufficiently well demonstrated that (1) => (2). Relatedly, given that the paper does not have a very clear theoretical contribution, it would be really helpful to demonstrate utility. It would be useful to extend experiments that apply these insights to developing novel regularizers or improving/simplifying hyperparameter tuning. <sep> Additionally, in the review process, the link was discovered to be weaker than originally suggested. The paper casts the relation in terms of the Fisher Information Matrix, which suggests it is theoretical and sound. After the discussion, it seems that viewing this relationship in terms of the Fisher Information Matrix is somewhat misleading. The three different regularization methods all regularize different norms of the gradient (L1 or L2), which are empirically, and under some assumption theoretically, related. More precisely, EWC regularizes the trace of the Empirical Fisher, which is equivalent to the L2 norm of the gradient of the loss function. SI regularizes a term similar to the L1 norm of the gradient. These effects were seen by the reviewers to be somewhat loosely related to the Fisher Information Matrix. <sep> Based on the above, I have to recommend rejection. I would like to thank the Authors for submitting the work for consideration to *CONF*. I hope the feedback will be useful for improving the work.
This paper proposed an additional training objective for unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT). They first train two UNMT models and use these models to generate pseudo parallel corpora. These parallel corpora are used to optimize the UNMT training objective. The experiments are conducted on several language pairs and they also compared with several alternative works. <sep> All the reviewers admit that the proposed method is straightforward and effective. The authors claim that the new training objective is used to enhance the "data diversification". This point has been questioned by the reviewers. Some reviewers are convinced by the response and some still have different opinions. From my point of view, the proposed method can also be considered as a kind of combination of (pseudo) supervised NMT and unsupervised NMT. <sep> The presentation and description of its key contributions seem unclear. However, we encourage the authors to modify their paper and we believe this proposed method can inspire the MT community for further research. At the moment, the paper is seen as not yet ready for publication at this time.
Three reviewers recommend rejecting or weak reject. The studied problem is interesting, but as one reviewer pointed out, it is not that clear how this work changes our theoretical understanding of those methods or what they imply for applications. Overall, I feel this work is on the borderline (probably it deserves higher score than the current score), but probably below the acceptance bar at the current form.
This paper examines adversarially trained robust models, and finds that accuracy disparity is higher than for standard models. The authors introduce a method they call Fair Robust Learning using Lagrange multipliers to minimize overall robust error while constraining the accuracy discrepancy between classes. <sep> In discussion, consensus was reached that the observations and approach are interesting but the paper is not yet ready for publication. The main concern is that it is not clear if the class accuracy disparity is due to adversarial training, or simply due to lower accuracy in general. Please see reviews and public discussion for further details.
The paper proposes a new framework for online hypothesis testing aimed at detecting causal effects (of treatments on outcomes) within subgroups in online settings where treatments are randomized. Such settings occur in online advertising where different versions of the same website may be presented to a set of otherwise exchangeable users via A/B testing. <sep> Under the standard causal assumptions of SUTVA, and sequential ignorability, in addition to a set of regularity conditions, the authors derive a result (Theorem 1) leading to an online test (Theorem 2). Since the resulting test's limiting distribution does not have an exact analytic form, the authors instead propose a bootstrap approach to determine a set of parameters to properly control the error rate. <sep> The author validate their approach by a simulation study, as well as via a user click log data from Yahoo! <sep> The reviewer opinion was somewhat split on this paper, in particular some reviewers raised concern about some (conceptually significant) typos, interpretability of assumptions, and the need for parametric assumptions (the dichotomy between linear models and neural networks is surely a false one -- the semi-parametric literature obtains nice parametric style results, although perhaps not always for tests, without assuming parametric likelihoods all the time).
This paper first makes the observation that incidental supervisory data can be used to define a new prior from which to calculate a PAC-Bayes generalization guarantee. This observation can be applied to any setting where there is unsupervised or semi-supervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning on labeled data. The PAC-Bayes bound is valid when applied to the fine-tuning. For example, one could use an L2 bound (derived from PAC-Bayes) on the difference between the fine-tuned parameters and pre-trained parameters. <sep> But the paper proposes evaluating the value of pre-training before looking at any labeled data. Let π0 be the prior before unsupervised or semi-supervised training and let π~ be the prior after pre-training. The paper proposes using the entropy ratio H(π0)/H(π~) as a measure of the value of the pre-training. As the reviewers note, this is not really related to PAC-Bayes bounds. Furthermore, it is clearly possible that the pre-training greatly focuses the prior but in a way that is detrimental to learning the task at hand. <sep> I have to side with the reviewers that feel that this is below threshold.
This paper addresses an interesting problem and all reviewers agree. Most reviewers found the paper difficult to understand and it was hard to see the novel contributions. The paper will need a significant revision before publication.
The paper has good contributions to a challenging problem, leveraging a Faster-RCNN framework with a novel self-supervised learning loss. However reviewer 4 and other chairs (in calibration) considered that the paper does not meet the bar for acceptance. The other reviewers did not champion the paper either, hence i am proposing rejection. <sep> Pros: <sep> R1 and R3 agree that the proposed model improves over related models such as MONET. <sep> The value of the proposed self-supervised loss connecting bounding boxes and segmentations is well validated in experiments. <sep> Cons: <sep> R4 gives good suggestions that may be useful to reach a broader readership, namely introducing more of the concepts used in the paper., e.g. "stick breaking, spatial broadcast decoder, multi-otsu thresholding" so it becomes more self-contained. R4 also suggests improving the writing more generally. <sep> R4 still finds the proposed "method quite complex yet derivative" after the rebuttal. <sep> All reviewers complain about lack of experiments in real data, but the authors did revise their paper and add some coco results in the appendix. These could be part of the main paper in a future version.
Three reviewers are mildly positive, while one is negative. The substantive comments of the reviewers are consistent with each other; it is merely their evaluations that differ. <sep> One contribution of the paper is that it shows how using temperature tuning can yield similar accuracy to using batch normalization; this is useful because batch normalization is not always possible. The revised paper shows improvements, and we appreciate the engagement of the authors with the reviewer comments. However, there are remaining weaknesses such as a weak argument based on the empirical.results. <sep> This paper can be improved based on the comments made by the reviewers. We encourage the authors to resubmit to a future venue.
This paper proposes a method for modeling higher-order interactions in Poisson processes. Unfortunately, the reviewers do not feel that the paper, in its current state, meets the bar for *CONF*. In particular, reviewers found the descriptions unclear and the justifications lacking. While the responses did aid the reviewers understanding, the paper would benefit from rewriting and more careful thought given to the experimental design.
This work proposes an efficient method for modelling long-range connections in point-cloud data. Reviewers found the paper to be generally well-written. On the less positive side, reviewers felt that the novelty of the work was marginal, and that the experimentation, limited to synthetic data in one domain, was too limited. These concerns remain after the discussion phase. In addition, the authors stated during the discussion that "Our goal is indeed to develop an efficient strategy to model LRIs in real chemical and materials systems", which conflicts with the presentation of the work as motivated by more general point cloud modelling problems. Given these weaknesses, the final decision was to reject.
The authors proposed to pre-process the original input features into a low dimensional term and its corresponding residual term via SVD. The paper empirically demonstrated the neural networks trained on such factorized exhibit faster convergence in training. Several issues of clarity were addressed during the rebuttal period by the authors. <sep> However, the reviewers still felt that there were some remaining fundamental issues with the paper, <sep> The motivation is not echoed in the experiments, namely most of the experiments on CIFAR and CatDog dataset using a low dimensional factorization of d=1 which is trivial and often part of the whitening preprocessing. <sep> The proposed factorization via SVD will be difficult to scale up to high dimensional features, large training sets and higher d >> 1. <sep> The empirical experiments show a marginal improvement in the training speed, especially in the image recognition tasks, yet there seems an early plateau in test performance when compared to the baselines. <sep> The theoretical analysis in Section 2 studied linear models. Yet, the rest of the paper focuses on non-linear neural networks. It is difficult to see the connection between the analysis and the rest of the paper. <sep> Thus, I recommend rejection of the paper at this time as the current version of the paper needs further development, and non-trivial modifications, to be broadly applicable.
The paper presents a self-supervised model based on a contrastive autoencoder that can make use of a small training set for upstream multi-label/class tasks. <sep> Reviewers have several concerns, including the lack of comparisons and justification for the setting, as well as the potentially narrow setting. Overall, I found the paper to be borderline, the cons slightly greater than the pros, so I recommend to reject it.
This paper analyzes several neighbor embedding methods-- t-SNE, UMAP, and ForceAtlas2-- by considering their objectives as consisting of attractive and repulsive terms. The main hypothesis is that stronger repulsive terms contribute towards learning discrete structures, while stronger attractive terms contribute towards learning continuous/manifold structures. The paper empirically explored the space parameterized by the relative weighting of the attractive and repulsive terms for the t-SNE and UMAP algorithms, using several data sets, and qualitatively confirmed their conclusions about the impact of the attractive and repulsion terms as the relative weights vary. <sep> The experimental validation of the paper's main hypothesis is thorough and the use of diverse data sets and neighbor embedding methods is appreciated-- as the authors point out, several reviewers missed this contribution. However, several reviewers point out that the insight presented in the paper is already largely present in the literature, and that beyond its analysis the paper does not present new algorithms based on this insight. The authors rebut this claim by arguing that the novelty of the paper lies in it: (1) showing the contrary to the established opinion, UMAP works despite, instead of because, it uses cross-entropy loss, and (2) the paper offers for the first time a theoretical understanding of why ForceAtlas2 highlights continuous developmental trajectories, and (3) prior work has not made the connection between UMAP, ForceAtlas2, and t-SNE or suggested using exaggeration throughout the optimization process for t-SNE rather than simply as a warm-up. The paper does indeed present intuitions for (1)-(3) based on the attraction-repulsion ideas, and makes the connection between these neighbor embedding algorithms by viewing them as variations on the theme of attraction-repulsion, but these intuitions are not significant steps forward with respect to what is already known about how neighbor embeddings balance attraction and repulsion. The mathematical analyses consist of stating the gradient for the algorithms and explaining how weighing the attraction and repulsion terms differently lead to different qualitative observations. The use of exaggeration throughout the optimization process is straightforward, and no strong mathematical characterization of the properties of the resulting algorithm is given. <sep> It is recommended that this paper be rejected, as it consists of a thorough empirical validation of an understanding of the trade-off between attractive and repulsive forces in neighbor embedding methods that was already present in the literature, along with some straightforward arguments connecting several popular neighbor embedding methods, but does not introduce any significantly new actionable insights or novel algorithms.
This paper considers convex optimization problems whose solutions involve the solution of linear systems defined in terms of the Hessian. It presents algorithms that reduce the runtime of standard iterative approaches to solving these problems by iteratively sketching the Hessian; the novelty lies in the fact that the authors use the idea of learned sketches which have been used prior for problems in data mining. In particular, the authors use the approach to learning sketches of Liu et al., 2020 to learn the entries in sparse sketching matrices for the Hessian, and propose using the Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms of Pilanci and Wainright, 2016 to iteratively solve the concerned optimization problem. The advantages of learned sketches are that they may allow using smaller sketch sizes while making progress on the problem, as they are learned to work well on the distribution of Hessians from which the problem instance is drawn. <sep> The consensus of the reviews is that the idea of using learned sketches for convex optimization seems to be novel, and this paper is an interesting attempt, but falls short of the level of contribution required for publication in *CONF*. The main concern is that the theory provided for the use of the learned sketches is incremental: the analysis does not reflect the fact that the sketches are learned; instead, the algorithm builds in a safeguard by using both a random sketch and a learned sketch, and the analysis uses the properties of the random sketch to proceed. The empirical results are suggestive, but the convergence rates of the learned and random sketches do not vary much, so the benefits seem marginal for most of the problems considered (with the exception of a standard least squares problem, for which we know learned sketching performs well). <sep> The paper is recommended to be rejected, as the theory is weak, and the empirical results are borderline.
The paper has two contributions. A novel benchmark for clinical multi-modal multi-task learning based on the already released MIMIC III and a multi-modal multi-task machine learning model. While the paper does show value in providing a curated benchmark and combining/unifying existing approaches to a timely problem, the reviewers agree that the paper provides insufficient novelty to warrant publication.
This paper is a systematic study of how assumptions that are present recent theoretical meta-learning bounds are satisfied in practical methods, and whether promoting these assumptions (by adding appropriate regularization terms) can improve performance of existing methods. The authors review common themes in theoretical frameworks for a meta learning setting that involves a feature learning step, based on which linear predictors for a variety of tasks are trained. Statistical guarantees for such a framework (that is, statistical guarantees for the performance of trained on an additional target task) are based on the assumption that the set of weight vectors of the linear predictors span the space (ie exhibit variety) and that the training tasks all enjoy a similar margin separability (that is, that the representation is not significantly better suited for some of the tasks than others). <sep> The current submission, cleanly reviews the existing literature, distills out these two properties and then proposes a regularization framework (that could be added to various meta-learning algorithms) to promote these properties in the learned feature representation. <sep> Finally, the authors experimentally evaluate to what degree the properties are already observed by some meta learning methods, and whether the proposed additions will improve performance. It is established that adding the regularization terms improves performance on most tasks. The authors thus argue that incorporating insights obtained form recent theoretical frameworks of analysis, can lead to improved performance in practice. Naturally, the purpose of the presented results is not to establish a new state of the art on a set of benchmark tasks, but to systematically study and compare the effect of adding regularization terms that will promote the properties that are desirable for a feature representation based on statistical bounds. <sep> I would argue that the research community should support this type of studies. The work is well presented and conducted. Most importantly, the study has a clear and general message, that will be valuable for researchers and practitioners working in on meta-learning. <sep> However, the reviewers did not recommend publishing this type of study for *CONF*. The authors are encouraged to resubmit their work to a different venue.
This paper evaluates the extent to which disentangled representations can be recovered from pre-trained GANs with style-based generators by finding an orthogonal basis in the space of style vectors, and then training an encoder to map images to coordinates in the resulting latent space. To construct the orthogonal basis, the authors consider 3 recently proposed methods for controllable generation, along with a newly developed generalization of one of these methods. The authors evaluate metrics for disentanglement for 4 datasets, consider an abstract visual reasoning task, and compute unfairness scores. <sep> Reviewers expressed diverging opinions on this paper. R2 is in support of acceptance, R3 finds the paper borderline but is leaning towards acceptance, whereas R4 is critical. R2 and R4 engaged in a relatively detailed discussion, but maintained their scores. <sep> Having read the paper, the metareviewer feels this submission indeed has strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, the main results are notable; it is worth reporting that disentangled representations can be recovered from pretrained GANs is a relatively straightforward manner. In this context, the metareviewer feels that some comments by R4 are more critical than is warranted. The authors do not necessarily have to show that GAN-based methods uniformly improve upon VAE-based methods, either in terms of disentanglement metrics or in terms of sensitivity to hyperparameters. The main claim in this submission is that GAN-based methods are mostly comparable to VAE-based methods, and this claim is both sufficiently notable and sufficiently supported by experimental results. <sep> At the same time, this submission is not without flaws. The writing is on the rough side, and as R4 notes the authors have removed all white space between paragraphs. The metareviewer also feels it is not satisfactory to show a box plot for GAN-based methods in Figure 2 and ask the reader to compare these plots to the violin plots for VAE-based methods in the Locatello paper. The authors need to find a way to make a more direct comparison here. R4's comments about the comparison in the abstract-reasoning setting are also well-taken –– here the baseline employs standard (entangled) models, so it is unclear what conclusions we should draw from this experiment. Similarly the unfairness results once again appeal to an indirect comparison to results in the Locatello paper on this topic. <sep> On balance, the metareviewer is inclined to say that this submission, in its current form, falls just below the threshold for acceptance. These results are clearly of note to the community and worth reporting, but the presentation has enough flaws that another round of reviews is warranted based on a revised manuscript. The metareviewer hopes to see this paper appear a conference in the (near) future.
All four knowledgeable referees have indicated reject due to many concerns. In particular, reviewers pointed out that the novelty of this paper is not clear because the difference from related work is very limited (i.e., the difference from Z. Wang and S. Ji is not clear, other than using one additional layer), and they were concerned that the results of the experiment are not convincing (For example, the results reported in this paper are significantly inferior to those reported in other papers, the GNN architecture used is limited, and the performance difference especially in the additional experiments in the revision, is very marginal). No reviewers were convinced by the authors' claims even through the author's rebuttal and revision. <sep> One important note: Reviewers have stated that they did not explicitly check the identity of the author and did not pose a problem on this, but if we follow the link specified in the original submission, we can see the identity of the author, which may be considered as a violation of the double-blind policy. This is a small and regrettable mistake, but it can be a serious problem in the review process. In this review process, reviewers unanimously suggested rejection even ignoring this issue, but it seems that you need to pay attention in your future submissions.
There was fairly detailed discussion among three of the four reviewers. The fundamental concern of the reviewers is regarding the contribution of the paper. During the rebuttal, the authors clarified the following: <sep> while the effects of varying uncertainty / horizon lengths is well-understood for Bayes-optimal policies, it is not understood for existing meta-RL approaches, which is the topic of this paper <sep> That is, the contribution of the paper is to understand the effects of varying uncertainty/horizon lengths for meta-RL approaches. However, it is known in prior work that meta-RL algorithms such as RL^2 can implement Bayes-optimal policies in principle. As a result, it's not clear whether this contribution is significant relative to prior knowledge, and this paper does not seem to bring any new insights. <sep> An alternative framing of the paper would be to consider the question of how meta-RL solutions compare to Bayes-adaptive optimal policies. While this framing would be interesting and novel, the current version of the paper does not sufficiently answer this question, since the only experiments include RL^2 (and such a study would require experimenting with more sophisticated meta-RL algorithms beyond RL^2). <sep> As such, this paper isn't suitable for publication at *CONF* in its current form.
The paper addresses learning with noisy labels, by detecting and correcting samples with noisy labels. Reviewers had concerns about the empirical evaluations, specifically about comparing to additional methods, about hyperparameter tuning, and about the improvements being vey small. There was also a concern that the analysis of the objective does not take into account explicitly the L2 regularization induced by weight decay. Based on these concerns the paper is not ready yet for publication.
The reviewers noted that this is an important, interesting but difficult topic. They appreciated that the authors clarified their assumptions in the theorem statements. Nevertheless, they recommend the authors to detail in depth when the method work better than the method where only the covariates are adjusted. They still think that the paper would require major modifications to be considered for publication hence the decision is rejection the paper.
Reviewer #2 has written a nice summary of the paper which I quote below. <sep> "The core idea is simple - which is a strength in my view - and does not require retraining the base language model, which could be important as language models become more expensive to train. However, the clarity and experiments in this paper fall short: the experimental setup has issues, the effect on perplexity is quite large but relegated to the Appendix, several claims are speculative and lacking corresponding experimental evidence, and it is unclear how the additional heuristics affect performance. <sep> The method seems promising, but with the current experiments it is difficult to draw conclusions about how the method affects performance and which parts of it are necessary; given that this is an empirical paper, I would therefore not recommend acceptance in its current form." <sep> Key Strengths <sep> Well-motivated problem of considerable interest <sep> A relatively straightforward Bayesian solution <sep> Proposed solution is computationally efficient compared to other competing approaches. <sep> The paper has been thoroughly reviewed by the reviewers and as a result numerous questions has surfaced. While the authors addressed most of the questions adequately, there are still many unanswered questions. They include: <sep> Readability issues highlighted by Reviewer #1 <sep> Reviewer #1: ""how did you measure model confidence about the toxicity label" <sep> Reviewer #4: The perplexity gets much worse as the gedi training is introduced (i.e. Λ decreases), e.g. going from 25 to 45 on IMDb. This result is in the Appendix, and perplexity is never evaluated/reported in the other experiments. <sep> Reviewer #4: Crucially, the GEDI training does not appear to help over just re-weighting with the conditional LM ( vs. ). Could the authors comment on this result? How well does domain transfer work for less similar domains? How is perplexity affected for the models reported in Table 2? <sep> Reviewer #4: How small can the conditional LM be? Why was medium used instead of small? What if large was used? Does the conditional LM need to be a large-scale pretrained model (it would be nice to see a baseline of a simpler conditional LM)? <sep> Several heuristics are used: weighting, nucleus filtering, keeping tokens over a threshold, repetition penalty, and rescaling the logits to positive (used in only one experiment). <sep> How does each of these affect performance? There are no ablations, and given the small differences in some of the experiments it is unclear whether performance would actually be worse if we changed one of the heuristics. One outcome may be that the method only works for a careful balance of hyperparameters, which could be fine, but we don't have a sense of the variation. <sep> Reviewer #2: The output in Table 6 makes me doubt how the experiments are badly controlled. The outputs from positive and negative sentiment are totally different and almost random text, meaning that the content of the generators is not controlled properly.
This paper proposes a new method to combine non-autoregressive (NAT) and autoregressive (AT) NMT. Compared with the original iterative refinement for non-autoregressive NMT, their method first generates a translation candidate using AT and then fill in the gap using NAT. <sep> All of the reviewers think the idea is interesting and this research topic is not well-studied. However, the empirical part did not convince all the reviewers. The revised version and response is good; however, it still does not solve some major concerns of reviewers.
The paper describes an RL technique to learn how to branch in discrete optimization. This advances the state of the art in comparison to previous imitation learning techniques. However, the reviewers and a public reader raised concerns about the validity of the experiments due to several inconsistencies and differences with previous work that might suggest some cherry picking. This is too bad since the reviewers really liked the work, but it is important to make sure that the experimental evaluation is done fairly. I read the paper and I share the concerns regarding the experimental methodology. Hence the experimental evaluation needs to be revised before publication.
This paper presents a knowledge distillation method for face recognition, by inheriting the teacher's classifier as the student's classifier and optimizing the student model with advanced loss functions. It received comments from three reviewers: 1 rated "Ok but not good enough - rejection", 1 rated "Marginally below" and 1 rated "Marginally above". The reviewers appreciate the simple yet clear methodology illustration and the well written paper. However, a number of major concerns are raised by the reviewers, including limited novelty, lack of comparison with more advanced knowledge distillation methods and their special case in face recognition. During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers' comments. However, the rating were not changed. The ACs concur these major concerns and more comprehensive comparisons with the state of the art KD methods are necessary to better illustrate the contribution of this work. Therefore, this paper can not be accepted at its current state.
The reviewers had some initial concerns about this submission. While the authors' rebuttal does a good job to address these concerns, the reviewers still have some doubts about the contribution of this paper and potential impact. In particular, it is not clear whether the performance improvements observed with the proposed algorithms is due to the ability to correct for noisy rewards or whether there are multiple other explanations for the improvement in performance. This makes it hard to predict whether the proposed algorithms will actually be useful in settings where noisy rewards or demonstration data are present.
This paper received 4 reviews with mixed initial ratings: 7, 5, 4, 5. The main concerns of R1, R2 and R4, who gave unfavorable scores, included: lack of methodological novelty (analysis-only paper), absence of experiments on real data (3 synthetic-only benchmarks), missing baselines and an overall inconclusive discussion. At the same time R5 notes that the offered fair comparison between SOTA methods was indeed "much needed", and the paper can "serve an important role" in guiding future developments in the community. In response to that, the authors submitted a new revision and provided detailed answers to each of the reviews separately. R1, R2 and R4 did not participate in the discussion, and R5 stayed with the positive rating. <sep> AC agrees with R5 that the provided analysis is insightful, and the effort put into organizing the research community around a single set of benchmarks and metrics is indeed valuable. However, given a simplistic nature of the proposed datasets and lack of other methodological contributions, the submission is not meeting the acceptance bar for *CONF*. After discussion with PCs, the final recommendation is to reject.
The paper presents a personalized federated learning approach using a mixture of global and local models. Four reviewers evaluated this paper; one of the reviewers is luke-warm (6) while the rest of the reviewers pretty negative to this work (3, 3, 3). The reviewers pointed out many weaknesses, especially about novelty, motivation, contribution, presentation, etc. Most importantly, although the idea of a "mixture of experts" makes sense, it is not clear what the real technical contribution of this paper is in terms of federated learning. <sep> Considering all the comments by the reviewers, I believe that this paper is not ready yet for publication. The authors need to improve the novelty and technical soundness of the proposed direction to convince the readers including reviewers.
The paper describes a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that uses Markov Random Fields. Unfortunately, the paper is not clearly written and would benefit from significant revisions that improve its structure and make the model and approximations more explicit. <sep> In particular, the paper says a graph says which agents i,j communicate. This is typically called the "coordination graph" in this setting, see <sep> "Collaborative Multiagent Reinforcement Learning by Payoff Propagation", Kok and Vlassis, 2006. Note that within that paper they provide Q-function decomposition, which can only serve to approximate the optimal policy. <sep> The authors of this submission claim that an MRF is sufficient for optimal policies. I fail to see how this is true. In particular, Proposition 1 has to be checked more carefully. I tried to go through it, but it did not seem to make sense to me. Why is there an exp() term in the definitoin of the optimal trajectory probability? Why would minimising the KL divergence be enough to obtain an optimal policy? Perhaps it gives an optimal policy within the class of MRF policies, but that's not the same thing as the globally optimal policy. <sep> Overall, I find the lack of clarity and in depth discussion of early related work disturbing, particularly with respect to the theoretical claims in the paper.
This paper received mixed reviews, 3 positives (7, 6, 6) and 2 negatives (4, 4). Due to the divergence of the reviews, I carefully read the paper and made my best efforts to understand the paper and the review comments. This paper proposes to learn a quantization network using a small calibration set given a network trained with the full precision. The combination of AdaQuant, integer programming, and batch-norm tuning makes sense although they do not have substantial novelty. The three components are reasonably tightly-coupled and comprise a complete algorithm. However, the sequential-AdaQuant distracts the main claim of this work significantly. This is probably added during the review process but looks ad-hoc to me. Sequential AdaQuant seems to be effective to improve accuracy, but cannot be applied before the bit allocation was set, which makes it require integer programming no more. Because of this issue, the overall presentation becomes confusing and the argument sometimes sounds unfair (please refer to the last posting by R5.). <sep> In addition, the presentation of this paper could be improved, especially for the details of the integer programming formulation. It is not clear how to define some variables mathematically. The discussion about the size of the calibration set together with the overfitting issue is lacking, and rigorous discussion and analysis would make the paper much stronger. The reviewers are not convinced of the novelty of this paper, and they rather believe that this is an engineering-oriented work. Considering this fact, the evaluation of this paper is not very comprehensive. The ablation study with respect to the size of the calibration set should be conducted more intensively. The experiment fails to show the benefit of mixed precision quantization effectively and it is limited to presenting the compression ratio in Figure 3. The authors used a small calibration set taken from the training dataset, which looks weird because they claim that the post-training quantization requires only a small "unlabeled" calibration set at the beginning of the abstract; it is more desirable to use arbitrary examples in the same domain. <sep> Despite the interesting aspects, I believe that this paper needs a focus and substantial improvement for publication, and, consequently, recommend rejection.
The paper considers exploiting low-rank structure in Q-function and the Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) to approximate the expectation in Q-learning to reduce the stochastic approxiamtion error, and thus, achieves "efficient RL". The authors tested the algorithm empirically within some simple environments. <sep> As reviewers (R1, R3, R4) mentioned, the major bottleneck of this algorithm is the assumption that the dynamics is known up to a constant, which is extremly strong, and thus, limits the application of the algorithm. I suggest the authors to consider the common RL setting, without any knowledge about the transition models, and make fair empirical comparison with baselines in the same setting.
The authors address the problem of self-supervised monocular depth estimation via training with only monocular videos. They propose to use additional information extracted from semantic segmentation at training time to (i) provide additional "semantic context" supervision and (ii) to improve depth estimation at discontinuities through an edge guided point sampling based approach. Results are presented on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets. <sep> One of the main concerns is related to the utility of the semantic supervision given the relative cost required to obtain semantic training data in the first place. The authors state that "the pixel-wise local depth information can not be well represented by current depth network". However, Guizilini 2020a can generate detailed depth edges and they do NOT require any semantic information during training. The authors also state that "the required labeled semantic dataset only accounts for a very tiny proportion, which indicates a relatively lower cost." This is a bit misleading. The proposed method uses per pixel semantic ground truth from three datasets (Mapillary Vistas, Cityscapes, and KITTI). It takes a lot of effort to provide this ground truth compared to self-supervised methods which do not require any ground truth depth. It is encouraging that dataset specific semantic finetuning does not seem to have a large impact (Table 3), but this still requires access to a large enough initial semantic training set. Finally, the quantitative results are not much better than methods that don't require any semantics e.g. Guizilini 2020a, Johnston and Carneiro. Clearly, methods that do not require semantics are much more scalable, especially when adapting to new types of scenes. <sep> Regarding the specific contributions of the paper, the SEEM module is the most novel component of the model. However, the addition of the SEEM module does not improve quantitative performance by much (see Table 2). In addition, the qualitative improvement it provides is also very subtle. This can be seen by comparing the last two rows of Fig 7 i.e. without and with. The authors need to make a stronger case, either quantitatively or qualitatively, as to why this is valuable. <sep> Finally, but only a minor concern, the following relevant reference is missing: Jiao et al. Look Deeper into Depth: Monocular Depth Estimation with Semantic Booster and Attention-Driven Loss, ECCV 2018 <sep> In conclusion, there were mixed views from the reviewers - with some supportive of the paper (R2&3) others not as enthusiastic (R1&4). The authors should be commended for their detailed responses and changes already made based on reviewer comments and suggestions. Unfortunately, this did not change the mind of the reviewers. It is the opinion of this AC that there is still more work required to fully show the utility of the proposed approach, especially considering the non trivial effort that is required to obtain semantic supervision in novel domains.
I think we did learn something new from this paper, and I think the reviewers all seem to agree with this. <sep> The observation you make about the objective seems correct and interesting (though reviewers and ACs do sometime miss errors), but I have the following complaints that keep me from recommending acceptance: <sep> The theory seems right, but in practice, all sorts of GANs with all sorts of objective functions experience "mode collapse", <sep> so it doesn't seem like the issue you point out w/ the NS-GAN objective can be the whole story. <sep> However, we generally don't ask of a paper that it tells the whole story all in one go... <sep> I do think the experiments are somewhat poorly done (compared to those for say the median paper about GANs that gets accepted to one of these conferences). Moreover, many people have made similar experimental claims to the ones that are in this paper that haven't held up on more complicated data sets, so I tend to apply more scrutiny to such claims when they're only evaluated on smaller tasks. <sep> There have, as R3 points out, been a huge number of papers proposing tricks for training GANs, and some of them work really well. <sep> What I'm missing from this paper is an exploration of the relationship between your observation and those (mostly ad-hoc) tricks. <sep> Does your observation explain why those tricks are necessary? <sep> Does it explain why some existing trick works as well as it does? <sep> If your observation is totally orthogonal to existing tricks, can you get much better performance on a challenging data set by using it? <sep> I don't feel like I got satisfactory answers to those questions. <sep> All this being said, the paper was borderline, and I think if you dealt with some of the complaints above you would have a pretty good shot of getting a revised version accepted at another major machine learning conference.
I thank the authors for their submission and very active participation in the author response period. I want to start by stating that I rank the paper higher as is currently reflected in the average score of the reviewers. The reasons for this are that a) R2 and R3, while responding to the author's rebuttal, do not seem to have updated their score or indicated that they want to keep their initial assessment of the paper -- in particular, R2 has acknowledged that additional experiments by the authors were useful and results on KeyCorridorS4/S5R3 are nice, and b) I disagree with R2's sentiment that MiniGrid is not a suitable testbed -- it is by now an established benchmark for evaluating RL exploration and representation learning methods (see list of publications on https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid). However, despite my more positive stance on the paper, I fully agree with R1 and R2 that a comparison to EC is needed in order to shed light into which factors of EC-SimCLR actually led to improvements in comparison to RIDE. I therefore recommend rejection, but I strongly encourage the authors to take the feedback from the reviewers and work on a revised submission to the next venue.
The paper analyzes connections between algorithmic fairness and domain generalization literatures. The reviewers found the paper interesting but they also raised some important concerns about it. <sep> The applicability of the method presented in the paper is not clear nor well-discussed in the paper. <sep> The papers and the revised version do not not cite important related work. <sep> The mathematical exposition in the paper is a bit hard to read. Even after revision, the reviewers find part of the paper(Appendix F) very hard to read. <sep> Overall, the paper in the current version is below the high acceptance bar of *CONF*.
This paper studies how to efficiently expose failures of "top-performing" segmentation models in the real world and how to leverage such counterexamples to rectify the models. The key idea is to discover most "controversial" samples from massive online unlabeled images. The approach is sound, well grounded, and quite logical. Results demonstrate the effectiveness. <sep> However, there exists some limitations coming from R2 and R3, for example, 1) Segmentation benchmarks may not require pixel-level dense annotation. There are also examples of benchmarks where the groundtruth consists of computer segmentations corrected by humans. 2) It is much harder for segmentation data to be class-balanced in the pixel level, making highly skewed class distributions common for this particular task. 3) Citing the field of computer-assisted annotation as relevant work. <sep> In the end, I think that this paper may not be ready for publication at *CONF*, but the next version must be a strong paper if above limitations can be well addressed.
The reviewers are in consensus that the manuscript is not ready for publication in its current form: more comprehensive evaluation, and careful analysis (either theoretical or empirical) of the simple-but-effective methodology would improve the quality further. The discussion was constructive and helped the authors to reason about their work better. <sep> The AC recommends Reject and encourages the authors to take the constructive feedback into consideration .
The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards. As the reviewers discussed, and also mentioned in their reviews, this paper bears stark similarity to work of 5 months ago, presented at the ICML 2020 Lifelong ML workshop, namely, "A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration", Mutti et al, 2020--MEPOL. What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments. The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin. Unfortunately this work does not meet the bar for acceptance relative to other submissions.
This paper presents a novel approach to grammar induction. Like older work by Klein and Manning, the paper finds benefit in jointly inducing both constituency and dependency structure. However, unlike most approaches to grammar induction, the model is not generative -- rather, it is a transformer-based architecture that is trained to optimize a masked language modeling objective. The resulting parses appear to beat non-trivial baselines, but direct comparisons with several relevant state-of-the-art systems are not drawn. Reviewers overall found the approach interesting and novel. However, nearly all reviewers raised serious concerns about experimental comparisons with related work and brought up several missing state-of-the-art baselines that, like the proposed system, do not require gold POS. Reviewers also pointed out issues with clarity in several sections. In rebuttal, authors provide a substantial update to the original draft. So substantial that all reviewers mentioned in discussion that the new draft would effectively require an entirely new review. While I applaud authors for the substantial revisions, and while *CONF* guidelines do not explicitly limit the amount change to a draft allowed in rebuttal, in this case the revisions are sufficiently drastic that I agree with reviewers that a new review process is required. Thus, I recommend rejection but strongly encourage authors to resubmit.
The work focuses on a new method for sampling hyper-parameter based on an "Population-Based Training" schedule that tend to sample more often configurations that gave good performances in the past. The authors have conducted experiments to verify the superior of their method, especially for the effectiveness and generalisability. <sep> Pros: <sep> simple method that can be implemented without much effort, <sep> good empirical performances on Imagenet, <sep> paper well organised and written. <sep> Cons: <sep> lack of explanation about the DensNet121 performance degradation [partially addressed in the rebuttal], <sep> additional simple experiments in Section 4.4 were recommended to evaluate the generality of the method [addressed in Table 5], <sep> empirical validation seems not sufficient [partially addressed in the rebuttal], <sep> similarity with respect to prior art, such as the focal loss [partially addressed in the rebuttal], <sep> clarification of the randomisation strategy in experiments [addressed in the rebuttal]. <sep> Despite most of the issues being addressed, the reviewers decided that this paper would benefit more work to be accepted for the conference this year.
This paper proposes two mechanisms, SelfNorm (used during training and inference) leveraging an attention-based recalibration of mean and standard deviation for instance normalization, and CrossNorm which performs cross-channel swapping of mean/stdev. Is is shown that the combination (often combined with AugMix) performs well across several datasets in terms of model robustness. Overall the paper has strength in the fact that the method is interesting, simple to implement, and modular. However, reviewers brought up a number of issues including the overstated motivation/writing, lack of clarity, and most importantly need for clear experimental results (comparing to uniform/standard baselines) and identification of the separate mechanisms. It is especially uncertain why it is necessary that they are used together (often with AuxMix as well) to obtain the strong performance. As a result, the score for this paper is borderline, tending towards a weak acceptance. <sep> It is appreciated that the authors provided a lengthy rebuttal, including new results in a different domain (NLP); however, the reviewers agreed that not all of the concerns were addressed. After a lengthy discussion, all of the reviewers agree that while the method is simple, modular, and effective when combined (hence the positive scores from some reviewers), the authors fail to describe the underlying reason for the method's gains, especially with respect to the individual parts (SelfNorm vs. CrossNorm) and why the results only come when these rather independently derived modules are used together. The exposition of the experimental results, with differing baselines/conditions that make it very hard to understand where the effect is coming from, exacerbates this issue. <sep> As a result of these concerns, I recommend rejection of this paper. However, the method is interesting and results promising, so I hope that the authors can clarify the writing and improve the presentation of the results (specifically separating out the effects of SelfNorm and CrossNorm, as well as analyzing how they interact together to improve results) and submit to a future venue.
The paper proposes a deep learning approach to blind image denoising based on deep unrolling. In particular, the proposed network is derived from convolutional sparse coding algorithms, which are unrolled, untied across layers and learned from data. The paper proposes a frequency domain regularization scheme in which the filters consist of a single analytically defined low-pass filter and a large collection of filters which are constrained to reside in the mid-to-high frequency ranges. It also proposes to tie the thresholds in the soft-thresholding stages of the learned network to estimates of the noise variance, making the proposed scheme more robust to variations in the noise level. <sep> Pros and Cons: <sep> [+] Having a single low-pass dictionary atom reduces redundancy (and potentially coherence) in the learned dictionary. This type of regularization may also reduce the time/data required to learn. <sep> [+/-] Using noise estimators and a noise adaptive threshold renders the model more robust to variations in the noise level. This is important, since in most denoising applications the noise level is not known a-priori. As the reviewers note, the idea of tuning thresholds in an unrolled sparse coding method based on the noise level is not a novelty of the paper; the novelty here is coupling this with a wavelet-based estimate of the noise level. <sep> [-] All three reviewers raise concerns regarding the novelty of the work compared to existing convolutional sparse coding-based neural networks. The structure of the network is similar; the main difference is the frequency restriction for learned atoms, which is enforced by prefiltering the learned atoms with a high-pass filter. <sep> [-] The paper is not entirely clear in its motivation and argumentation. Reducing the coherence of the learned dictionary makes sense from the perspective of certain worst case results from sparse approximation. However, the coherence is a worst case quantity; moreover, certain approaches to coherence control (e.g., using large stride) control coherence at the expense of the expressiveness of the dictionary, and hence may not actually improve its ability to provide sparse reconstructions of natural signals. The proposed frequency domain regularization is a sensible approach to controlling coherence, since low-frequency atoms will tend to be highly coherent, but would benefit from a crisper analytical motivation. <sep> [-] Reviewers found the experiments lacking in some regards. In particular, the paper only evaluates its proposals on synthetic experiments with Gaussian noise. While this is in line with some previous work on deep learning based denoising, more extensive and realistic experiments would have bolstered the paper's argument. <sep> Overall, the paper makes a sensible proposal regarding the adaptivity to unknown noise levels, and introduces a potentially useful frequency-domain restriction on the learned filters in a CSC network. However, the reviewers did not find that the paper made a clear argument for the significance of these proposals, and raised other concerns regarding the clarity and experiments. The consensus of the reviewers is to recommend rejection.
For many problems such as ligand-protein binding, quantitative structure activity prediction (QSAR), predicting protein function from structure, etc., the 3D geometry of the molecules is of great importance. One way to represent this is simply to assign locations to all atoms in 3-dimensional space. If using graph convolutional kernels or other relational representations such that aligning molecules is not necessary, these approaches with 3D geometry can be efficient and far more effective than 1D or 2D representations. The contribution of the paper is to make this point and to produce a resource with this kind of 3D data. Such a resource would be of high value. Nevertheless, reviewers feel provision of such a resource is perhaps not a major contribution to the *CONF* and ML communities. There is a sense that more innovative and substantial contribution would come from addressing also the challenge that 3D geometry can changes and that there may be multiple low-energy conformations of biomolecules that should be considered. The authors contend that unlike ligands which are small and may have many low-energy conformations, large biomolecules have a much more constrained conformational space. <sep> This meta-reviewer is sympathetic to the authors' point and appreciates the importance of the resource. Nevertheless, even large biomolecules often have some portions of flexible conformation and high 3D structure variation that should be considered. And indeed addressing the kind of multiple instance problem that arises by considering multiple conformations of large molecules or of ligands binding to large molecules would certainly require and likely yield bigger *CONF*/ML innovations. In the end the paper contributes a useful resource but does not excite the reviewers substantially enough, without those extensions or others, for a recommendation of acceptance at this time.
This paper proposed a new measure of effective gradient flow (EGF), and also compared sparse vs. dense networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The notion of EGF would be interesting, but the paper did not present enough evidence to support this notion.
The main idea of the paper is to use image data to guide radar data acquisition by focusing on the blocks where the object has appeared. Four reviewers have relatively consistent rating: 3 of them rated "Ok but not good enough - rejection", while 1 rated "clear rejection". The main concerns include ad-hoc choices of algorithm design, lack of algorithm novelty, not adequate experiments in illustrating the performance, etc. During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers' comments. However, the major concerns remain, and the rating were not changed. While the motivation is clear and the work has merits, the ACs agree with the reviewers' concerns and this paper can not be accepted at its current state.
Although the paper studies a relevant and important topic, which is about learning of hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised manner, the reviewers raised several critical concerns. In particular, although the hierarchical structure of concepts is the key idea in this paper, the concept of hierarchy itself is not well explained. How to define the hierarchical level of concepts should be carefully and mathematically discussed. In addition, empirical evaluation is not thorough as reviewers pointed out. Although we acknowledge that the authors addressed concerns by the author response, newly added results are still confusing and more careful treatment is needed before publication. I will therefore reject the paper. <sep> This work reminds me the the topic called "formal concept analysis" (e.g. see [1]), which mathematically defines concepts as closed sets and constructs a hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised manner. This method can be viewed as co-clustering and also has a close relationship to closed itemset mining. This approach is used in machine learning (e.g. [2]). I think it is beneficial for the authors to refer such existing and well-established approaches to elaborate this work further. <sep> [1] Davey, B.A., Priestley, H.A.: Introduction to Lattices and Order, Cambridge Univ. Press (2002)[2] Yoneda, et al., Learning Graph Representation via Formal Concept Analysis, arXiv:1812.03395
The reviews were a bit mixed: on one hand, by combining and adapting existing techniques the authors obtained some interesting new results that seem to complement existing ones; on the other hand, there is some concern on the novelty and on the interpretation of the obtained results. Upon independent reading, the AC agrees with the reviewers that this paper's presentation can use some polishing. (The revision that the authors prepared has addressed some concerns and improved a lot compared to the original submission.) Overall, the analysis is interesting but the significance and novelty of this work require further elaboration. In the end, the PCs and AC agreed that this work is not ready for publication at *CONF* yet. Please do not take this decision as an under-appreciation of your work. Rather, please use this opportunity to consider further polishing your draft according to the reviews. It is our belief that with proper revision this work can certainly be a useful addition to the field. <sep> Some of the critical reviews are recalled below to assist the authors' revision: <sep> (a) The result in Theorem 4.1 needs to be contrasted with a single machine setting: do we improve the convergence rate in terms of T here? do we improve the constants in terms of L and M here? What is the advantage one can read off from Theorem 4.1, compared to a single machine implementation? How should we interpret the dependence of (optimal) H on r and lambda_2? <sep> (b) The justification for T≥n4 is a bit weak and requires more thoughts: one applies distributed SGD because n is large. What happens if T does not satisfy this condition in practice, as in the experiments? <sep> (c) Extension 1 perhaps should be more detailed as its setting is much more realistic than Theorem 1. One could use Theorem 1 to motivate and explain some high level ideas but the focus should be on Extension 1-3. In extension 2, the final bound seems to be exactly the same as in Theorem 1, except a new condition on T. Any explanations? Why asynchronous updates only require a larger number of interactions but retain the same bound? These explanations would make the obtained theoretical results more accessible and easier to interpret.
All reviewers agree that this paper is interesting, but needs improvement in order to be suitable for a highly competitive venue such as *CONF*. Reviewer 3 is especially incisive and detailed, but other reviewers make similar points.
Well, this paper has achieved something remarkable in this review process: The initial scores came in at fairly low scores (4, 5, 3, 6). However, as the discussions / rebuttals went back and forth, the reviewers were able understand and see the merits of the proposed methodology. Namely, the setting of L2E (Learning to Exploit), which makes use of a novel method called Opponent Strategy Generation, to quickly generate very different types of opponents to play against. One more pertinent component is the use of MMD (maximum mean discrepancy regularization) which can remove the necessity of dealing with task distributions, and does a better job in creating diverse opponents. <sep> Having understood the technical approach, three of the reviewers decided to substantially increase their scores. R4 increased 4->6, R5 increased 5->6, R3 increased 3->4, while R2 held steady with a score of 6. It was also good to see empirical favorable results compared to other baseline methods: L2E had the best return against unclear opponents, such as Rocks opponent and Nash opponent. <sep> Without any reviewer arguing strongly for acceptance, the program committee decided that the paper in its current form does not quite meet the bar, and also that it would benefit from another revision.
The paper proposes a new meta-learning algorithm which promises greater robustness to adversarial examples. I will be brief, as the fault with the paper is quite clear: the experimental results are not sufficient. The attack used (FGSM) is particularly dated and weak, and the comparison to existing defences is insufficient. Additionally, prior work (Adversarially Robust Few-Shot Learning: A Meta-Learning Approach) obtains better results, and is not compared against. The reviewers provided further criticism regarding the motivation for and explanation of the method, but the empirical aspects of the paper are where it primarily falls short of the publishable standard for *CONF*. <sep> I recommend rejection, and invite the authors to consider demonstrating robustness to a wider range of attacks (including non-gradient based), and a more thorough comparison to defence methods, before resubmitting to another conference.
The paper proposes a method for offline meta-RL, where we meta-train on pre-collected offline data for several RL tasks and adapt to a new task with a small amount of data. The paper assumes that there is no interaction with the environment either during meta-train or meta-test. In this setting, motivated by the ide of leveraging offline experience from multiple tasks to enable fast adaptation to new tasks, the paper introduces MACAW, which combines the consistent MAML and the popular offline AWR, improving upon them by adding capacity through parameterization and adding an extra objective in the policy update. As a result, the MACAW proposed for the offline meta-RL has the desirable property of being consistent, i.e., converging to a good policy if enough time and data for the meta-test task are given, regardless of meta-training. <sep> Pros: <sep> Most of the experiments are well executed, using good baselines. Extensive ablations on the various modifications to MAML+AWR confirmed the utility of the approach for the fully offline meta-RL problem. <sep> MACAW is a simple algorithm with theoretical guarantees; the modifications to the policy functions are backed by theory. <sep> Cons: <sep> The reviewers have concerns on the formulation of offline meta-RL. One major contribution of the paper is to introduce offline meta-RL. However the paper largely borrows the meta-RL formulation from the online setting where task=MDP. The reviewers think that directly borrowing from regular meta-RL as the formulation of offline meta-RL might be misleading. The reviewers suggest including behavior policy as part of the task definition for offline meta-RL formulation. <sep> Several reviewers raised concerns that the fully offline setting might be unrealistic. Although the author did add a motivation, the reviewers would be interested in seeing MACAW being adapted online at test time on in-distribution tasks. <sep> Unfortunately, the authors accidentally revealed their names in one of the modified versions.
This paper investigates the topic of nondeterminism and instability in neural network optimization. The reviewers found the results on different sources of nondeterminism particularly interesting and relevant. The experiments are carried on both language and also vision, which strengthens the findings. Concerns were raised about the use of smaller non-standard models, which were somewhat mitigated by the addition of Resnet-18 experiments on CIFAR. The reviewers also noted that the measures used in the experimental protocol were already present in the literature, and that the proposed mitigation strategy is from another work. Furthermore, R2 also found that the optimization instability section should be more developed. The paper should be resubmitted with an improved discussion of related works and more developed section on instability as suggested by the reviewers.
The new non linearity proposed in this paper present interesting observations and improvements on image and text datasets. <sep> However, reviewers point out that there should've been more comparisons to other efficient transformers and on more datasets. <sep> The speed improvements are also not clear. <sep> I'd encourage the authors to revise and submit in the future.
This paper proposes an interesting collaborative multi-head attention (MHA) method to enable heads to share projections, which can reduce parameters and FLOPs of transformer-based models without hurting performance on En-De translation tasks. For pre-trained language models, a tensor decomposition method is used to easily covert the original MHA to its collaborative version without retraining. <sep> This paper receives 3 weak reject and 1 weak accept recommendations. On one hand, all the reviewers agree that the paper is well motivated and the proposed idea is interesting. On the other hand, all the reviewers also commented that the current empirical results and comparisons are weak, which are not enough to support the paper's main claim. From the current results, it is difficult to draw a conclusion that collaborative MHA is better. <sep> Specifically, (i) From Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed method is not effective for pre-trained models, i.e., even if the model size is not reduced much, the performance can be dropped significantly. (ii) More experiments, such as QA, more translation/generated tasks will make this paper more convincing. (iii) More rigorous experiments are needed to justify the practical value of the proposed method. If the authors try to emphasize that they go beyond practical realm, then probably a careful re-positioning of the paper is needed, which may not be a trivial task. <sep> The rebuttal unfortunately did not fully address the reviewers' main concerns. Therefore, the AC regrets that the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance at this time. The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.
Unfortunately some of the reviewers' reactions to the author feedback won't be visible to the authors. <sep> The reviewers highly appreciated the replies and revision of the paper <sep> Pros: <sep> The paper renders Generalized Exploration tractable for deep RL. <sep> The idea is applicable to many DRL methods and is potentially very valuable to deal with the headaches associated to DRL. <sep> Cons: <sep> R2 and R4 are still concerned about whether 'smart' exploration will always be advantageous, and whether the added complexity is a good trade-off for the (potentially) better performance. A comparison to 'pure' exploration would still be insightful. <sep> the new 'SAC with Deep Coherent Exploration' only partially addresses the concerns of R2 and R4, especially in terms of performance <sep> While the paper has improved drastically during the reviewing process, there are still a few too many doubts.
The paper provides an interesting set of theoretical ideas to improve the estimation of normalizing flows on datasets that fail to be fully dimensional. Although the method is appealing, I believe the paper falls a bit short of acceptance at the conference. Too many practical issues are left out, as discussed by reviewers, and the method seems promising but not fully connected to the rest of the literature on estimating low-dimensional distributions living in high dimensional spaces. We encourage the authors to use the feedback contained in this round of reviews to improve their work.
Three reviewers have reviewed this manuscript, and they had severe reservations regarding the presentation quality and the lack of sufficient theoretical support behind empirical observations. Even after rebuttal, the reviewers maintained that the above issues are not fully resolved. Unfortunately, this paper cannot be accepted in its current form.
This paper is certainly on the way to be a solid contribution: it's an interesting research question, and we need more understanding papers (rather than yet another algorithmic trick paper). <sep> The reviewers thought the paper was not yet ready. The reviewers suggested: (1) more motivation of why the proposed metrics were of interest, (2) clearer discussion and evidence of how the analysis better articulates the performance of PER, (3) missing empirical details like methodology for setting hyper-parameters, why these 9 Atari games, undefined errorbars, unspecified number of runs, and (4) conclusions not supported by evidence in Atari: with missing experiment details, likely too few runs, and overlapping errorbars in most games few scientific conclusions can be drawn. <sep> The work might be strengthen by developing the first part of the paper (and focussing on the reviewer's suggestions) and deemphasizing the novel algorithmic contribution part.
The authors propose two linguistic verifiers for improving extractive question answering when the question is answerable. The first replaces the interrogative in the question with candidate answers and evaluates the result both in isolation and in combination with the answer-containing sentence to do answer verification. The second jointly encodes individual sentences and spans with questions in a hierarchical manner to improve use of context in answer prediction performance. <sep> The reviews for this paper are roughly on the cusp: 2 reviewers rate the paper a bit below the acceptance threshold, 1 a bit above, and then 1 now rates the paper as a solid Accept. <sep> Pros <sep> The main strength of the paper, certainly as emphasized by the most positive reviewer is the strong empirical results. Especially on SQuAD v2, the method here seems to roughly equal the current leading system on the leaderboard. <sep> The paper also proposes two methods for improving question answering that make sense, are relatively simple, and work <sep> Cons <sep> The writing and presentation of the paper is not that great. Even at the level of the introduction, the writing just is not very focused: The first page has a lot of background and tutorial information on MRC that just doesn't get to the point of where this paper is situated and what it contributes. <sep> Neither of the proposed systems are that novel (though it is interesting to see that they still have value even in the age of large contextual language models) <sep> The paper lacks ML novelty <sep> The methods appear to be significantly more expensive to run <sep> Some empirical comparisons appear to be lacking <sep> As well as the missing comparisons mentioned by some reviewers, I think that there are a number of other missing relevant datapoints. While not denying that gathering the available results for NewsQA/TriviaQA is much less straightforward than with that nice leaderboard for SQuAD, aren't there are lot of systems with better results on TriviaQA that aren't mentioned in the paper. These include: RoBERTa and SpanBERT (mandarjoshi); BigBird-ETC see https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/c8512d142a2d849725f31a9a7a361ab9-Paper.pdf; Longformer; SLQA see https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1158.pdf . <sep> But, overall, I think the decision on this paper comes down to focus and contributions. Not withstanding the growing size of *CONF*, I would like to think that it is not just another ML and ML applications conference, but it is a conference centered on representation learning. The present paper, no matter its quality and strong results, just isn't a contribution to representation learning. It is a much better fit to an NLP conference where it would be a strong contribution to question answering, showing the continuing value of linguistic methods like question rewriting in answer validation. But this just isn't a contribution within the focus of representation learning. Just as R4 does, I encourage the authors to clean up the presentation of the paper a bit and to submit it to an NLP conference, where it would be a strong contribution, for the reasons that R3 emphasizes.
This paper studies the tensor principal component analysis problem, where we observe a tensor T = \\beta v^{\\otimes k} + Z where v is a spike and Z is a Gaussian noise tensor. The goal is to recover an accurate estimate to the spike for as small a signal-to-noise ratio \\beta as possible. There has been considerable interest in this problem, mainly coming from the statistics and theoretical computer science communities, and the best known algorithms succeed when \\beta \\geq n^{k/4} where n is the dimension of v. The main contribution of this paper is to leverage ideas from theoretical physics and build a matrix whose top eigenvector is correlated with v for sufficiently large \\beta using trace invariants. On synthetic data, the algorithms achieve better performance than existing methods. <sep> The main negative of this paper is that it is not so clear how tensor PCA is relevant in machine learning applications. The authors gave some references to applications of tensor methods, but I want to point out that all of those works are about using tensor decompositions, which despite the fact that they are both about tensors, are rather different sorts of tools. Many of the reviewers also found the paper difficult to follow. I do think exposition is particularly challenging when making connections between different communities, as this work needs to introduce several notions from theoretical physics. I am also not sure how novel the methods are, since a somewhat recent paper Moitra and Wein, "Spectral Methods from Tensor Networks", STOC 2019 also uses tensor networks to build large matrices whose top eigenvalue is correlated with a planted signal, albeit for a different problem called orbit retrieval.
The paper studies the problem of satisfying group-based fairness constraints in the situation where some demographics are not available in the training dataset. The paper proposes to disentangle the predictions from the demographic groups using adversarial distribution-matching on a "perfect batch" generated by a clustered context set. <sep> Pros: <sep> The problem of satisfying statistical notions of fairness under "invisible demographics" is a new and well-motivated problem. <sep> Creative use of recent works such as DeepSets and GANs applied to the fairness problem. <sep> Cons: <sep> Makes a strong assumption that the clustering of the context set will result in a partitioning that has information about the demographics. This requires at the very least a well-behaved embedding of the data w.r.t. the demographic groups, and a well-tuned clustering algorithm (where optimal tuning is difficult in practice on unsupervised problems) -- but at any rate, as presented, the requirements for a "perfect batch" is neither clear nor formalized. <sep> Lack of theoretical guarantees. <sep> Various concerns in the experimental results (i.e. proposed method does not clearly outperform other baselines, high variance in experimental results, and other clarifications). <sep> Overall, the reviewers agreed the studied problem is new, interesting and relevant to algorithmic fairness; however, there were numerous concerns (see above) which were key reasons for rejection.
This work proposes a novel reparameterization of batch normalization that is hypothesized to give a better inductive bias for learning several tasks, including neural architecture search, conditional image generation, adversarial robustness and neural style transfer. The reviewers indicate that this is useful and is of interest to the *CONF* audience, but they are not satisfied with the analysis offered in the paper. Specifically, the reviewers request that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of why the proposed reparameterization improves results, given that it does not change the expressive power of the model class. Additionally, the reviewers have some concerns about the structure of the paper. I therefore recommend rejecting the paper at this time.
This paper introduces an object perception and control method for RL, derived from a control-as-inference formulation within a POMDP. The paper provides a theoretical derivation and experiments where the proposed joint-inference approach outperforms baselines. <sep> The discussion focussed on understanding the paper's contribution relative to prior work. The reviewers highlighted the similarities with earlier systems (R1, R2, R4), the unclear benefits of joint inference over independently trained modules in the experiments (R3), and the lack of clarity of the presentation (R1, R2, R3). The authors responded to some of these criticisms, bolstering the paper with additional experiments to show the benefits of joint inference and increasing the discussion of related work. The reviewers examined the revisions and rebuttal and found the paper still did not resolve all their original concerns. Two limitations mentioned in the final phase of the discussion were the use of a single environment to evaluate the general framework, and continuing doubts on the contribution of joint inference mechanism to the measured performance. <sep> Four knowledgeable reviewers indicate reject as their concerns were not adequately resolved. The paper is therefore rejected.
The paper proposes to address the out-of-distribution generalization problem by means of conditional computation in form of a feature modulating module. <sep> While the approach is interesting and brings a new take on how to perform feature modulation (although initially felt too similar to Conditional Batch Normalization) some major concerns about the experiments and validation of the approach are raised by all reviewers. Some of the hypothesis made are also challenged due to lack of proper validation. <sep> Although the discussion clarified some points I am afraid many open questions are left unanswered and would require a more work to be fully addressed before acceptance.
This paper performs visual odometry using variational information bottleneck. It assumes video and pose observations and aims to find a latent state that is maximally predictive of the pose observations, while minimizing the mutual information between the image observations and the latent state. It approximates this cost using variational inference. The paper also makes use of deterministic+stochastic latent transition models, as in Hafner et al 2019, 2020. The paper contributes generalization bounds that are based on recent work by Xu and Raginsky 2017 and Zhang et al 2018. This is useful to include, but this contribution is not the main focus of the work in my opinion, and it is not clear how tight the bounds are, especially considering that the original cost function is approximated. <sep> Pros: <sep> The idea of using the deterministic+stochastic transition models of Hafner et al and related works for visual odometry is very interesting and promising avenue for research. <sep> The fact that the experiments are done on some of the major camera and IMU datasets is great. <sep> Needs fixing: <sep> Major: The paper mentions "Extensive ablation studies were conducted to examine the effects of (1) the deterministic component, (2) sample size and (3) extra sensors.". These are great, but I would also have expected to see a range of variations in terms of the weight gamma, including a value of zero. The appendix is vague in this regard and says " and <sep> perform a non-intensive and small-range grid searching." The utility of the information bottleneck idea depends heavily on the weight gamma, and I would have liked more results confirming that the method does well under a range of choices for gamma. <sep> Major: The rotation results produced by this method on EuroC should be improved to be more competitive with okvis. As it stands, it is unclear why the method does not perform as well and the explanations offered in the paper are speculative. <sep> Medium: The paper also mentions in the appendix: "Though 3D von Mises-Fisher distribution and 4D-Bingham distribution can be <sep> arguably more appropriate to model Euler angles and quaternions respectively, it is non-trivial to evaluate and use them for training in practice." So, the paper represents rotations using Euler angles. The authors are encouraged to look at https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/publication/202004-iclr-deep_orientation_uncertainty_learning/ <sep> Minor: MSCKF was originally coined by Mourikis and Roumeliotis https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642 and even though the term is used by follow-up works, it is worth adding the reference. <sep> Finally, I would disagree with one of the reviewers that this paper needs to compare with ORBSLAM2. I think comparing with OKVIS and an MSCKF variant is sufficient for "classic" SLAM and odometry methods. <sep> I think the paper needs one more iteration to fix these issues, even though it is very promising work.
