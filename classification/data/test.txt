2018-344	* Main contributions are clear <sep>	strength
2018-344	Cons: <sep> * There is confusion between keywords and topics, which is leading to a somewhat confused explanation and lack of clear comparison with previous work.	weakness

2018-344	* Typos and grammatical errors are numerous <sep>	weakness
2018-344	As the authors noted, the concerns about the small dataset are not necessarily warranted, but I would encourage the authors to measure the statistical significance of differences in results, which would help alleviate these concerns. <sep>	suggestion
2018-344	An additional comment: it might be worth noting the connections to query-based or aspect-based summarization, which also have a similar goal of performing generation based on specific aspects of the content. <sep>	suggestion
2018-344	Overall, the quality of the paper as-is seems to be somewhat below the standards of *CONF* (although perhaps on the borderline), but the idea itself is novel and results are good.	decision

2018-351	This submission is a continuation of a line of theoretical work that seeks to characterize optimization landscapes of neural networks by the presence or absence of spurious local minima.	abstract
2018-351	As the number of critical points grows combinatorially for larger networks, it is very challenging to show such results.	abstract
2018-351	The present submission extends slightly previous work by considering two hidden units and their proof technique goes beyond that of Brutzkus and Globerson, 2017, potentially leading to more interesting results if they can be extended to more complex networks. <sep>	abstract
2018-351	The setting of two hidden units is quite limited - far from any practical setting.	weakness
2018-351	If this were the stepping stone to proving optimality of certain optimization strategies for more complex networks, this may be of some interest, but it seems doubtful.	weakness
2018-351	One indication is given in sec 7 / Fig.	weakness

2018-356	While interesting, I find the application to multi-layer linear networks extremely limiting.	weakness
2018-356	There appears to be a sub-field in theory now focusing on solely multi-layer linear networks which is meaningless in practice.	weakness
2018-356	I can appreciate that this could give rise to useful proof techniques and hence, I am recommending it to the workshop track with the hope that it can foster more discussions and help researchers move away from studying multi-layer linear networks.	decision

2018-372	the problem is interesting, and the approach is also interesting.	strength
2018-372	however, the reviewers have found that this manuscript would benefit from more experiments, potentially involving some real data (even at least for evaluation) in addition to largely synthetic data sets used in the submission.	suggestion

2018-394	The authors report on extensive empirical results using a wide variety of training methods, including supervised learning and several flavors of RL (PPO, A2C, DQN) as well as single-agent vs. multi-agent training.	abstract
2018-394	The reviewers also appear to agree that the method appears to be technically correct, clearly written, and easy to read. <sep>	strength
2018-394	A drawback of the paper is that it does not make a *significant* contribution to the field.	weakness
2018-394	In combing through the reviewer comments, none of them identify a significant contribution.	weakness
2018-394	Even in the text of the paper, the authors do not anywhere claim to have made a significant contribution.	weakness
2018-394	As the paper is still interesting, the committee would like to recommend this for the workshop track. <sep>	decision
2018-394	Pros: <sep> Interesting domain with tunable complexity <sep>	strength
2018-394	High-quality extensive empirical results <sep>	strength
2018-394	Writing is clear <sep>	strength
2018-394	Cons: <sep> Lacks a significant contribution <sep>	weakness
2018-394	Appears to overlook self-play, the dominant RL training paradigm for decades (multiagent training appears to be related but different) <sep>	weakness
2018-394	Per Reviewer3, "I remain unconvinced that these games are good general tests for Deep RL	weakness

2018-397	This paper turned out to be quite difficult to call.	misc
2018-397	My take on the pros/cons is: <sep> 1. The research topic, how and why humans can massively outperform DQN, is unanimously viewed as highly interesting by all participants. <sep>	strength
2018-397	2. The authors present an original human subject study, aiming to reveal whether human outperformance is due to human knowledge priors.	strength
2018-397	The study is well conceived and well executed.	strength
2018-397	I consider the study to be a contribution by itself. <sep>	strength
2018-397	3. The study provides prima facie evidence that human priors play a role in human performance, by changing the visual display so that the priors cannot be used. <sep>	abstract
2018-397	4. However, the study is not definitive, as astutely argued by AnonReviewer2.	weakness
2018-397	Experiments using RL agents (with presumably no human priors) yield behavior that is similar to human behavior.	weakness
2018-397	So it is possible that some factor other than human prior may account for the behavior seen in the human experiments. <sep>	weakness
2018-397	5. It would indeed be better, as argued by AnonReviewer2, to use some information-theoretic measure to distinguish the normal game from the modified games. <sep>	suggestion
2018-397	6. The paper has been substantially improved and cleaned up from the original version. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2018-397	7. AnonReviewer1 provided some thoughtful detailed discussion of how the authors may be overstating the conclusions that one can draw from the paper. <sep>	weakness
2018-397	Bottom line: Given the procs and cons of the paper, the committee recommends this for workshop.	decision

2018-401	Authors present a method for representing DNA sequence reads as one-hot encoded vectors, with genomic context (expected original human sequence), read sequence, and CIGAR string (match operation encoding) concatenated as a single input into the framework.	abstract
2018-401	Method is developed on 5 lung cancer patients and 4 melanoma patients. <sep>	abstract
2018-401	Pros: <sep> - The approach to feature encoding and network construction for task seems new. <sep>	strength
2018-401	- The target task is important and may carry significant benefit for healthcare and disease screening. <sep>	strength
2018-401	Cons: <sep> - The number of patients involved in the study is exceedingly small.	weakness
2018-401	Though many samples were drawn from these patients, pattern discovery may not be generalizable across larger populations.	weakness
2018-401	Though the difficulty in acquiring this type of data is noted. <sep>	weakness
2018-401	- (Significant) Reviewer asked for use of public benchmark dataset, for which authors have declined to use since the benchmark was not targeted toward task of ultra-low VAFs.	rebuttal_process
2018-401	However, perhaps authors could have sourced genetic data from these recommended public repositories to create synthetic scenarios, which would enable the broader research community to directly compare against the methods presented here.	suggestion
2018-401	The use of only private datasets is concerning regarding the future impact of this work. <sep>	weakness
2018-401	- (Significant) The concatenation of the rows is slightly confusing.	weakness
2018-401	It is unclear why these were concatenated along the column dimension, rather than being input as multiple channels.	weakness
2018-401	This question doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper. <sep>	weakness
2018-401	Given the pros and cons, the commitee recommends this interesting paper for workshop.	decision

2018-441	This method makes a connection between evolutionary and variational methods in a particular model.	abstract
2018-441	This is a good contribution, but there has been little effort to position it in comparison to standard methods that do the same thing, showing relative strengths and weaknesses. <sep>	weakness
2018-441	Also, please shorten the abstract.	suggestion

2018-500	The reviewers all outlined concerns regarding novelty and the maturity of this work.	weakness
2018-500	It would be helpful to clarify the relation to doubly stochastic kernel machines as opposed to random kitchen sinks, and to provide more insight into how this stochasticity helps.	suggestion
2018-500	Finally, the approach should be tried on more difficult image datasets.	suggestion

2018-503	The problem addressed here is an important one: What is a good evaluation metric for generative models?	abstract
2018-503	A good selection of popular metrics are analyzed for their appropriateness for model selection of GANs.	abstract
2018-503	Two popular approaches are recommended: the kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1-NN) two-sample test.	abstract
2018-503	This seems reasonable, but the present work was not recommended for acceptance by 2 reviewers who raised valid concerns. <sep>	rating_summary
2018-503	From a readability perspective, it would be nice to simply list the answer to question (1) directly in the introduction.	suggestion
2018-503	One must read more than a few pages to get to the answer of why the metrics that are advocated were picked.	weakness
2018-503	It need not read like a mystery. <sep>	weakness
2018-503	R4: "The evaluations rely on using a pre-trained imagenet model as a representation.	weakness

2018-503	The use of learned representations needs more rigorous justification" <sep>	rebuttal_process
2018-503	R2: "First, it only considers a single task for which GANs are very popular.	weakness
2018-503	Second, it could benefit from a deeper (maybe theoretical analysis) of some of the questions."	weakness
2018-503	- the first point of which is also related to a concern of R4. <sep>	misc
2018-503	Given the overall high selectivity of *CONF*, the present submission falls short.	decision

2018-508	The reviewers were unanimous in their assessment that the paper was not ready for publication in *CONF*.	rating_summary
2018-508	Their concerns included: <sep> - lack of novelty over Niepert, Ahmed, Kutzkov, ICML 2016 <sep>	weakness
2018-508	- The approach learns combinations of graph kernels and its expressive capacity is thus limited <sep>	weakness
2018-508	- The results are close to the state of the art and it is not clear whether any improvement is statistically significant. <sep>	weakness
2018-508	The authors have not provided a response to these concerns.	rebuttal_process

2018-530	This paper presents a memory architecture for RL based on reservoir sampling, and is meant to be an alternative to RNNs.	abstract
2018-530	The reviewers consider the idea to be potentially interesting and useful, but have concerns about the mathematical justification.	weakness
2018-530	They also point out limitations in the experiments: in particular, use of artificial toy problems, and a lack of strong baselines.	weakness

2018-538	The paper concerns the development of a density network for estimating uncertainty in recommender systems.	abstract
2018-538	The submitted paper is not very clear and it is hard to completely understand the proposed method from the way it is presented.	weakness

2018-552	Studying only depth 2 and depth 3 networks is very limiting.	weakness

2018-561	The authors propose a technique for weight pruning that leaves block diagonal weights, instead of unstructured sparse weights, leading to faster inference.	abstract
2018-561	However, the experiments demonstrating the quality of the pruned models are insufficient.	weakness
2018-561	The authors also discuss connections to random matrix theory; but these connections are not worked out in detail.	weakness

2018-565	While the reviewers considered the basic idea of adding supervision intermediate to differentiable programming style architectures to be interesting and worthy of effort, they were unsure if <sep> 1: the proposed abstractions for discussing ntm and nram are well motivated/more generally applicable <sep>	weakness

2018-577	This paper resulted in significant discussion -- both between R2 and the authors, and between the AC, PCs, and other solicited experts. <sep>	misc
2018-577	The problem of language grounding (and instruction following) in virtual environments is clearly important, this work was one of the first in the recent resurgence, and the goal of understand what the agents have learned is clearly noble and important.	strength
2018-577	In terms of raw recommendations, the majority reviewer recommendation is negative, but since concerns raised by R2 seemed subjective (which in principle is not a problem), out of abundance of caution, we solicited additional input.	rating_summary
2018-577	Unfortunately, we received feedback consistent with the concerns raised here: <sep> -- The lack of generality of the behavior found.	weakness
2018-577	Even if we ignore the difficult question of why the agent prefers what it does, it's unclear how the conclusions here generalize much farther than the model and environment used; the manuscript does not provide any novel or transferable principals of the form "this kind of bias in the environment leads to this kind of bias in models with these properties". <sep>	weakness
2018-577	-- We realize even providing that concrete a statement might be hard, but also missing are thorough comparisons to other kinds of models (eg non-deep, as asked by R1) to establish that this is a general phenomenon. <sep>	weakness
2018-577	Ultimately, there is a sense that this is too narrow an analysis, too soon.	weakness
2018-577	If there was one architecture for learning embodied agents in 3d environments that was clearly successful and useful, then studying its properties might be interesting (even crucial).	weakness
2018-577	But the dust in this space isn't settled.	weakness
2018-577	Our current agents are fairly poor, and so the impact of understanding the biases of a specific model trained in a specific environment seems fairly low. <sep>	weakness
2018-577	Finally -- this not taken into consideration in making the decision -- it is not okay to list personal homepage domains (that may reveal author identity to ACs) as conflict domains; those are meant for institutional conflicts/domains.	weakness

2018-580	This paper received divergent ratings (7, 3, 3).	rating_summary
2018-580	While there is value in thorough evaluation papers, this manuscript has significant presentation issues.	weakness
2018-580	As all three reviewers point out, the way it is currently written, it misrepresents the claims made by Mirowski et al 2016 and over-reaches in its findings.	weakness
2018-580	Unfortunately, we cannot make a decision on what the manuscript may look like in future once these issues are fixed, and must reject.	decision

2018-589	This paper studies to what extent adversarial training affects the properties of adversarial examples in object classification. <sep>	abstract
2018-589	Reviewers found the work going in the right direction, but agreed that it needs further evidence/focus in order to constitute a significant contribution to the *CONF* community.	weakness
2018-589	In particular, the AC encourages authors to relate their work to the growing body of (mostly concurrent) work on robust optimization and adversarial learning.	suggestion
2018-589	For the above reasons, the AC recommends rejection at this time.	decision

2018-591	This paper addresses the question of how to solve image super-resolution, building on a connection between sparse regularization and neural networks. <sep>	abstract

2018-591	The AC thus recommends rejection at this time.	decision

2018-605	The paper proposes a new convolutional network architecture, called CrescendoNet.	abstract
2018-605	Whilst achieving competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, the accuracy of the proposed model on CIFAR-100 is substantially lower than that of state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters; the paper presents no experimental results on ImageNet.	weakness
2018-605	The proposed architecture does not provide clear new insights or successful new design principles.	weakness
2018-605	This makes it unlikely the current manuscript will have a lot of impact.	weakness

2018-607	The paper presents a boosting method and uses it to train an ensemble of convnets for image classification.	abstract
2018-607	The paper lacks conceptual and empirical comparisons with alternative boosting and ensembling methods.	weakness
2018-607	In fact, it is not even clear from the experimental results whether or not the proposed method outperforms a simple baseline model that averages the predictions of T independently trained convolutional networks.	weakness

2018-613	The authors propose to use identity + some weights in the recurrent connections to prevent vanishing gradients.	abstract
2018-613	The reviewers found the experiments to have weak baselines, weakening the claims of the paper.	weakness

2018-616	+ The paper proposes an interesting empirical measure of "learnability" of a trained network: how well the predictive function it represents can be learned by another network.	abstract
2018-616	And shows it empirically seems to correlate with better generalization. <sep>	abstract
2018-616	- The work is purely empirical: it features no theory relating this learnability to generalization <sep>	weakness
2018-616	- Learnability measure is somewhat ad-hoc with moving parts left to be specified (learning network, data splits,..) <sep>	weakness
2018-616	- as pointed out by a reviewer, learnability doesn't really provide any answers for now. <sep>	weakness
2018-616	- the work would be much stronger if it went beyond a mere correlation study, and if learnability considerations allowed to derive a new approach/regularization scheme that was convincingly shown to improve generalization.	suggestion

2018-622	Proposed network compression method offers limited technical novelty over existing approaches, and empirical evaluations do not clearly demonstrate an advantage over current state-of-the-art. <sep>	weakness
2018-622	Paper presentation quality also needs to be improved.	weakness

2018-623	The paper makes overly strong claims, too weakly supported by a hard to follow and insufficiently rigorous mathematical argument.	weakness
2018-623	Connections with a large body of relevant prior literature are missing.	weakness

2018-626	The paper received borderline-negative scores (6,5,5) with R1 and R2 having significant difficulty with the clarity of the paper.	rating_summary
2018-626	Although R3 was marginally positive, they pointed out that the experiments are "extremely weak".	weakness
2018-626	The AC look at the paper and agrees with R3 on this point.	misc
2018-626	Therefore the paper cannot be accepted in its current form.	decision
2018-626	The experiments and clarity need work before resubmission to another venue.	decision

2018-628	The paper received scores of 5,5,5, with the reviewers agreeing the paper was marginally below the acceptance threshold.	rating_summary
2018-628	The main issue, raised by both R2 and R3 was that connection between representation learning in deep nets and coding theory was not fully justified/made.	weakness
2018-628	With no reviewer advocating acceptance, it is not possible to accept the paper unfortunately.	decision

2018-631	The paper received weak scores: 4,4,5.	rating_summary
2018-631	R2 complained about clarity.	weakness
2018-631	R3's point about the lack of fully connected layers in current SOA deepnets is very valid and the authors response far from convincing.	rebuttal_process
2018-631	Unfortunately the major revision provided by the authors was not commented on by the reviewers, but many of the major shortcomings of the work still remain. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2018-631	Generally, the paper is below the acceptance threshold, so cannot be accepted.	decision

2018-651	This paper tackles a very important problem: evaluating natural language generation.	abstract
2018-651	The paper presents an overview of existing unsupervised metrics, and looks at how they correlate with human evaluation scores.	abstract
2018-651	This is important work and the empirical conclusions are useful to the community, but the datasets used are too limited and the authors agree it would be better to use newer bigger and more diverse datasets suggested by reviewers for drawing more general conclusions.	weakness
2018-651	This work would indeed be much stronger if it relied on better, more recent datasets; therefore publication as is seems premature.	decision

2018-653	While using self-play for training a goal-oriented dialogue system makes sense, the contribution of this paper compared to previous work (that the paper itself cites) seems too minor, and the limitations of using toy synthetic data further weaken the work.	weakness

2018-658	The paper builds on earlier work by Wang et al (2015) on Visual Concepts (VCs) and explores the use of VCs for few-shot learning setting for novel classes. <sep>	abstract
2018-658	The work, as pointed out by two reviewers is somewhat incremental in nature, with main novelty being the demonstration of utilities of VCs for few shot learning.	weakness
2018-658	This would not have been a big limitation if the paper had a carefully conducted empirical evaluation providing insights on the effect of various configuration settings/hyperparameters on the performance in few shot learning, which two of the reviewers (Anon3, Anon2) state are missing.	weakness
2018-658	The paper falls short of the acceptance threshold in its current form. <sep>	decision

2018-672	Given the cons pointed out by reviews, the AC is recommending that the paper be rejected.	decision

2018-694	Pros: <sep> + The idea of end-to-end training that simultaneously learns the weights and appropriate precision for those weights is very appealing. <sep>	strength
2018-694	Cons: <sep> - Experimental results are far from the state-of-the-art, which makes the empirical evaluation unconvincing. <sep>	weakness
2018-694	- More justification is needed for the update of the number of bits using the sign of the gradient.	weakness

2018-698	The reviewers agree that the authors have made an interesting contribution studying the effect of data augmentation, but they also agree that the claims made by the paper require a broader empirical study beyond the limited number of tasks surveyed in the current revision.	weakness

2018-703	This paper presents a neural compositional model for visual question answering.	abstract
2018-703	The overall idea may be exciting but the committee agrees with the evaluation of Reviewer 1:  the experimental section is a bit thin and it only evaluates against an artificial dataset for visual QA that does not really need a knowledge base.	weakness
2018-703	It would have been better to evaluate on more traditional question answering settings where the answer can be retrieved from a knowledge base (WebQuestions, Free917, etc.	suggestion
2018-703	), and then compare with state of the art on those.	suggestion

2018-712	All reviewers agree that the contribution of this paper, a new way of training neural nets to execute Monte-Carlo Tree Search, is an appealing idea.	strength
2018-712	For the most part, the reviewers found the exposition to be fairly clear, and the proposed architecture of good technical quality.	strength
2018-712	Two of the reviewers point out flaws in implementing in a single domain, 10x10 Sokoban with four boxes and four targets.	weakness
2018-712	Since their training methodology uses supervised training on approximate ground-truth trajectories derived from extensive plain MCTS trials, it seems unlikely that the trained DNN will be able to generalize to other geometries (beyond 10x10x4) that were not seen during training.	weakness
2018-712	Sokoban also has a low branching ratio, so that these experiments do not provide any insight into how the methodology will scale at much higher branching ratios. <sep>	weakness
2018-712	Pros: Good technical quality, interesting novel idea, exposition is mostly clear.	strength
2018-712	Good empirical results in one very limited domain. <sep>	strength
2018-712	Cons: Single 10x10x4 Sokoban domain is too limited to derive any general conclusions. <sep>	weakness
2018-712	Point for improvement: The paper compares performance of MCTSnet trials vs. plain MCTS trials based on the number of trials performed.	weakness
2018-712	This is not an appropriate comparison, because the NN trials will be much more heavyweight in terms of CPU time, and there is usually a time limit to cut off MCTS trials and execute an action.	weakness
2018-712	It will be much better to plot performance of MCTSnet and plain MCTS vs. CPU time used.	suggestion

2018-713	All three reviewers are in agreement that this paper is not ready for *CONF* in its current state.	rating_summary

2018-730	The paper addresses the training time of CNNs, in the common setting where a CNN is trained on one domain and then used to extract features for another domain.	abstract
2018-730	The paper proposes to speed up the CNN training step via a particular proposed training schedule with a reduced number of epochs.	abstract
2018-730	Training time of the pre-trained CNN is not a huge concern, since this is only done once, but optimizing training schedules is a valid and interesting topic of study.	strength
2018-730	However, the approach here does not seem novel; it is typical to adjust training schedules according to the desired tradeoff between training time and performance.	weakness
2018-730	The experimental validation is also thin, and the writing needs improvement.	weakness

2018-731	This paper applies a form of recurrent autoencoder for a specific type of industrial sensor signal analysis.	abstract
2018-731	The application is very narrow and the data set is proprietary.	weakness
2018-731	The approach is not clearly described, but seems very straightforward and is not placed in context of prior work.	weakness
2018-731	It is therefore not clear how to evaluate the contribution of the method.	weakness
2018-731	The authors have revised the paper to include more details and prior work, but it still needs a lot more work on all of the above dimensions before it can make a significant contribution to the *CONF* community.	rebuttal_process

2018-736	Pro: <sep> - This approach to modeling discrete regression problems is interesting and may hold potential, but the evaluation is not in a state where strong meaningful conclusions can be made. <sep>	strength
2018-736	Con: <sep> - Reviewers raise multiple concerns regarding evaluation and comparison standards for tasks.	weakness
2018-736	While authors have added some model comparisons in response, in other areas comparisons don't appear complete.	rebuttal_process
2018-736	For example, when using MRI data, networks compared all use features derived from images, rather than systems that may learn from images themselves.	rebuttal_process
2018-736	Authors claim dataset is too small to learn directly from pixels in this data (in comments), but transfer learning and data augmentation have been successfully applied to learn from datasets of this size.	rebuttal_process
2018-736	In addition, new multitask techniques in the imaging domain have also been presented that dynamically learn the network structure, rather than relying on a hand-crafted neural network design.	rebuttal_process
2018-736	How this approach would compare is not addressed.	rebuttal_process

2018-739	Reviewers unanimous in assessment that manuscript has merits, but does not satisfy criteria for publication. <sep>	rating_summary
2018-739	Pros: <sep> - Potentially novel application of neural networks to survival analysis with competing risks, where only one terminal event from one risk category may be observed. <sep>	strength

2018-739	- Architecture novelty may not be significant. <sep>	weakness
2018-739	- Small performance gains (though statistically significant)	weakness

2018-755	This paper does not meet the bar for *CONF* - neither in terms of the quality of the write-up, nor in experimental design.	decision
2018-755	The two confident reviewers agree to reject the paper, the weak accept comes from a less confident reviewer who did not write a good review at all.	rating_summary
2018-755	The rebuttal does not change this assessment.	rebuttal_process

2018-759	PROS: <sep> 1. All the reviewers thought that the work was interesting and showed promise <sep>	strength
2018-759	2. The paper is relatively well written <sep>	strength
2018-759	CONS: <sep> 1. Limited experimental evaluation (just MNIST) <sep>	weakness
2018-759	The reviewers were all really on the fence about this but in the end felt that while the idea was a good one and the authors were responsive in their rebuttal, the experimental evaluation needed more work.	rebuttal_process

2018-773	The reviewers are unanimous in their opinion that the theoretical results in this paper are of limited novelty and significance.	weakness
2018-773	Several parts of the paper are not presented clearly enough.	weakness
2018-773	As such the paper is not ready for *CONF*-2018 acceptance.	decision

2018-781	The paper proposes a method to map input probability distributions to output probability distributions with few parameters.	abstract
2018-781	They show the efficacy of their method on synthetic and real stock data.	abstract
2018-781	After revision they seemed to have added another dataset, however, it is not carefully analyzed like the stock data.	rebuttal_process
2018-781	More rigorous experimentation needs to be done to justify the method.	weakness

2018-789	The paper proposes a new model called differential decision tree which captures the benefits of decision trees and VAEs.	abstract
2018-789	They evaluate the method only on the MNIST dataset.	weakness
2018-789	The reviewers thus rightly complain that the evaluation is thus insufficient and one also questions its technical novelty.	weakness

2018-804	The proposed conditional variance regularizer looks interesting and the results show some promise.	strength
2018-804	However, as the reviewers pointed out, the connection between the information-theoretic argument provided and the final form of the regularizer is too tenuous in its current form.	weakness
2018-804	Since this argument is central to the paper, the authors are urged to either provide a more rigorous derivation or motivate the regularizer more directly and place more emphasis on its empirical evaluation.	suggestion

2018-811	The reviewers agreed that the paper was too long (more than twice the recommended page limit not counting the appendix) and difficult to follow.	weakness
2018-811	They also pointed out that its central idea of learning the noise distribution in a VAE was not novel.	weakness
2018-811	While the shortened version uploaded by the authors looks like a step in the right direction, it was not sufficient to convince the reviewers.	rebuttal_process

2018-812	The reviewers are in agreement, that the paper is a big hard to follow and incorrect in places, including some claims not supported by experiments.	weakness

2018-828	The authors present GraphVAE, a method for fitting a generative deep model, a variational autoencoder, to small graphs.	abstract
2018-828	Fitting deep learning models to graphs remains challenging (although there is relevant literature as brought up by the reviewers and anonymous comments) and this paper is a strong start. <sep>	strength
2018-828	In weighing the various reviews, AnonReviewer3 is weighed more highly than AnonReviewer1 and AnonReviewer2 since that review is far more thorough and the reviewer is more expert on this subject.	misc
2018-828	Unfortunately, the review from AnonReviewer1 is extremely short and of very low confidence.	rating_summary
2018-828	As such, this paper sits just below the borderline for acceptance.	decision
2018-828	In general, the main criticisms of the paper are that some claims are too strong (eg non-differentiability of discrete structures), treatment of related work (missing references, etc.)	weakness
2018-828	and weak experiments and baselines.	weakness
2018-828	The consensus among the reviews (even AnonReviewer2) is that the paper is preliminary.	weakness
2018-828	The paper is close, however, and addressing these concerns will make the paper much stronger. <sep>	suggestion

2018-839	The reviewers agreed that this paper is not quite ready for publication at *CONF*.	rating_summary
2018-839	One of the reviewers thought the paper was well written and easy to follow while the two others said the opposite.	strength
2018-839	One of the main criticisms was issues with the composition.	weakness
2018-839	The paper seems to lack a clear formal explanation of the problem and the proposed methodology.	weakness
2018-839	The reviewers in general weren't convinced by the experiments, complaining about the lack of a required baseline and that the proposed method doesn't seem to significantly help in the experiment presented. <sep>	weakness

2018-845	Regarding clarity, while the paper definitely needs work if it is to be resubmitted to an ML venue, different revisions would be appropriate for a physics audience.	suggestion

2018-878	Dear authors, <sep>	misc
2018-878	The reviewers appreciated your work and recognized the importance of theoretical work to understand the behaviour of deep nets.	strength
2018-878	That said, the improvement over existing work (especially Montufar, 2017) is minor.	weakness
2018-878	This, combined with the limited attraction of such work, means that the paper will not be accepted. <sep>	decision

2019-117	The manuscript builds on the build on the box lattice model, extending prior work by relaxing the box embeddings via Gaussian convolutions.	abstract
2019-117	This is shown to be particularly effective for non-overlapping boxes, where the previous method fail. <sep>	abstract
2019-117	The primary weakness identified by reviewers was the writing, which was thought to be lacking some context, and may be difficult to approach for the non-domain expert.	weakness

2019-138	This method proposes a criterion (SNIP) to prune neural networks before training.	abstract
2019-138	The pro is that SNIP can find the architecturally important parameters in the network without full training.	strength
2019-138	The con is that SNIP only evaluated on small datasets (mnist, cifar, tiny-imagenet) and it's uncertain if the same heuristic works on large-scale dataset.	weakness

2019-201	Strengths:  The paper tackles the difficult problem of automatic robot design.	strength
2019-201	The approach uses graph neural networks to parameterize the control policies, which allows for weight sharing / transfer to new policies even as the topology changes.	strength
2019-201	Understanding how to efficiently explore through non-differentiable changes to the body is an important problem (AC).	strength

2019-201	In response, the authors clarified the nomenclature and description of a number of the baselines, and added others.	rebuttal_process
2019-201	AC: there is no submitted video (searches for "video" on the PDF text produces no hits); this is seen by the AC as being a real limitation from the perspective of evaluation. <sep>	weakness
2019-201	AC agrees with some of the reviewer remarks that some of the original stated claims are too strong. <sep>	weakness
2019-201	AC: the simplified fluid model of Mujoco (http://mujoco.org/book/computation.html#gePassive) is unable to model the fluid state, in particular the induced fluid vortices that are responsible for a good portion of fish locomotion, ie, "Passive and active flow control by swimming fishes and mammals" and other papers.	weakness
2019-201	Acknowledging this kind of limitation will make the paper stronger, not weaker; <sep>	suggestion
2019-201	the ML community can learn from much existing work at the interface of biology and fluid mechancis. <sep>	suggestion
2019-201	There remain points of contention, ie, the sufficiency of the baselines.	weakness

2019-231	p.s.: It seems that centering the weight matrices at initialization is a key idea.	abstract
2019-231	The authors note that Dziugaite and Roy used  bounds that were based on the distance to initialization, but that their reported numerical generalization bounds also increase with the increasing network size.	abstract
2019-231	Looking back at that work, they look at networks where the size increases by a very large factor (going from eg 400,000 parameters roughly to over 1.2 million, so a factor of 2.5), at the same time the bound increases by a much smaller factor.	abstract
2019-231	The type of increase also seems much less severe than those pictured in Figures 3/5.	abstract
2019-231	Since Dzugate and Roy's bounds involved optimization, perhaps the increase there is merely apparent.	abstract

2019-258	AR3 is the most critical regarding lack of explanations, eg why linear addition of two word embeddings is bad and why the corrective term proposed here is a good idea.	weakness
2019-258	The authors suggest that linear addition is insufficient when final meaning differs from the individual meanings and show tome quantitative results to back up their corrective term. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-258	On balance, all reviewers find the theoretical contributions sufficient which warrants an accept.	rating_summary

2019-274	The paper proposes a new method that builds on the Bayesian modelling framework for GANs and is supported by a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation that shows very promising results.	abstract
2019-274	All reviewers agree, that the method is interesting and the results are convincing, but that the model does not really fit in the standard Bayesian setting due to a data dependency of the priors.	weakness

2019-312	In summary, from the discussion, the major points of contention were the somewhat lacking initial evaluation (which was fixed to a large extent) and the quality of writing (which could be fixed more).	weakness
2019-312	I believe the submission is genuinely novel, interesting (esp.	decision
2019-312	the usage of world model-like techniques) and valuable for the *CONF* audience so I recommend acceptance.	decision

2019-314	This paper presents a method for measuring the degree to which some representation for a composed object effectively represents the pieces from which it is composed.	abstract
2019-314	All three authors found this to be an important topic for study, and found the paper to be a limited but original and important step toward studying this topic.	strength
2019-314	However, two reviewers expressed serious concerns about clarity, and were not fully satisfied with the revisions made so far.	rebuttal_process
2019-314	I'm recommending acceptance, but I ask the authors to further revise the paper (especially the introduction) to make sure it includes a blunt and straightforward presentation of the problem under study and the way TRE addresses it. <sep>	decision
2019-314	I'm also somewhat concerned at R2's mention of a potential confound in one experiment.	weakness
2019-314	The paper has been updated with what appears to be a fix, though, and R2 has not yet responded, so I'm presuming that this issue has been resolved. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-314	I also ask the authors to release code shortly upon de-anonymization, as promised.	suggestion

2019-316	The submission proposes a method to construct adversarial attacks based on deforming an input image rather than adding small peturbations.	abstract
2019-316	Although deformations can also be characterized by the difference of the original and deformed image, it is qualitatively and quantitatively different as a small deformation can result in a large difference. <sep>	abstract
2019-316	On the positive side, this paper proposes an interesting form of adversarial attack, whose success can give additional insights on the forms of existing adversarial attacks.	strength
2019-316	The experiments on MNIST and ImageNet are reasonably comprehensive and allow interesting interpretation of how the image deforms to allow the attack.	strength
2019-316	The paper is also praised for its clarity, and cleaner formulation compared to Xiao et al (see below).	strength
2019-316	Additional experiments during rebuttal phase partially answered reviewer concerns, and provided more information eg about the effect of the smoothness of the deformation. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-316	There were some concerns that the paper primarly presents one idea, and perhaps missed an opportunity for deeper analysis (R1).	weakness
2019-316	R2 would have appreciated more analysis on how to defend against the attack. <sep>	weakness
2019-316	A controversial point is the relation /  novelty with respect to Xiao et al, *CONF* 2018.	weakness
2019-316	As eg pointed out by R1: "The paper originates from a document provably written in late 2017, which is before the deposit on arXiv of another article (by different authors, early 2018) which was later accepted to *CONF* 2018 [Xiao and al.].	weakness
2019-316	This remark is important in that it changes my rating of the paper (being more indulgent with papers proposing new ideas, as otherwise the novelty is rather low compared to [Xiao and al.])." <sep>	weakness
2019-316	On the balance, all three reviewers recommended acceptance of the paper.	rating_summary
2019-316	Regarding novelty over Xiao et al, even ignoring the arguable precedence of the current submission, the formulation is cleaner and will likely advance the analysis of adversarial attacks.	strength

2019-318	The paper is well written and easy to follow.	strength
2019-318	The experiments are adequate to justify the usefulness of an identity for improving existing multi-Monte-Carlo-sample based gradient estimators for deep generative models.	strength
2019-318	The originality and significance are acceptable, as discussed below. <sep>	strength
2019-318	The proposed doubly reparameterized gradient estimators are built on an important identity shown in Equation (5).	strength
2019-318	This identity appears straightforward to derive by applying both score-function gradient and reparameterization gradient to the same objective function, which is expressed as an expectation.	strength
2019-318	The AC suspects that this identity might have already appeared in previous publications / implementations, though not being claimed as an important contribution / being explicitly discussed.	weakness
2019-318	While that identity may not be claimed as the original contribution of the paper if that suspicion is true, the paper makes another useful contribution in applying that identity to the right problem: improving three distinct training algorithms for deep generative models.	strength
2019-318	The doubly reparameterized versions of IWAE and reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) further show how IWAE and RWS are related to each other and how they can be combined for potentially further improved performance. <sep>	strength
2019-318	The AC believes that the paper makes enough contributions by well presenting the identity in (5) and applying it to the right problems.	strength

2019-333	The paper presents an adversarial learning framework for active visual tracking, a tracking setup where the tracker has camera control in order to follow a target object.	abstract
2019-333	The paper builds upon Luo et al 2018 and proposes jointly learning  tracker and target policies (as opposed to tracker policy alone).	abstract
2019-333	This automatically creates a curriculum of target trajectory difficulty, as opposed to the engineer designing the target trajectories.	abstract
2019-333	The paper further proposes a method for preventing the target to fast outperform the tracker and thus cause his policy to plateau.	abstract
2019-333	Experiments presented justify the problem formulation and design choices, and outperform Luo et al .	abstract
2019-333	The task considered is  very important, active surveillance with drones is just one sue case. <sep>	abstract
2019-333	A downside of the paper is that certain sentences have English mistakes, such as this one:  "The authors learn a policy that maps raw-pixel observation to control signal straightly with a Conv-LSTM network.	weakness
2019-333	Not only can it save the effort in tuning an extra camera controller, but also does it outperform the..." However, overall the manuscript is well written, well structured, and easy to follow.	strength

2019-351	This paper proposes a novel method of solving inverse problems that avoids direct inversion by  first reconstructing various piecewise-constant projections of the unknown image (using a different CNN to learn each)  and then combining them via optimization to solve the final inversion. <sep>	abstract
2019-351	Two of the reviewers requested more intuitions into why this two stage process would  fight the inherent ambiguity. <sep>	weakness
2019-351	At the end of the discussion, two of the three reviewers are convinced by the derivations and empirical justification of the paper. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-351	The authors also have significantly improved the clarity of the manuscript throughout the discussion period. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-351	It would be interesting to see if there are any connections between such inversion via optimization with deep component analysis methods, eg "Deep Component Analysis via Alternating Direction Neural Networks " of Murdock et al , that train neural architectures to effectively carry out the second step of optimization, as opposed to learning a feedforward mapping.	suggestion

2019-356	To borrow the succinct summary from R1, "the paper suggests a method for generating representations that are linked to goals  in reinforcement learning.	abstract
2019-356	More precisely, it wishes to learn a representation so that two states are similar if the policies leading to them are similar."	abstract
2019-356	The reviewers and AC agree that this is a novel and worthy idea. <sep>	strength
2019-356	Concerns about the paper are primarily about the following. <sep>	misc
2019-356	(i) the method already requires good solutions as input, ie, in the form of goal-conditioned policies, (GCPs) <sep>	weakness
2019-356	and the paper claims that these are easy to learn in any case. <sep>	weakness
2019-356	As R3 notes, this then begs the question as to why the actionable representations are needed. <sep>	weakness
2019-356	(ii) reviewers had questions regarding the evaluations, ie, fairness of baselines, additional comparisons, and additional detail. <sep>	weakness
2019-356	After much discussion, there is now a fair degree of consensus.	misc
2019-356	While R1 (the low score) still has a remaining issue with evaluation, particularly hyperparameter evaluation, they are also ok with acceptance.	rating_summary
2019-356	The AC is of the opinion that hyperparameter tuning is of course an important issue, but does not see it as the key issue for this particular paper. <sep>	misc
2019-356	The AC is of the opinion that the key issue is issue (i), raised by R3.	misc
2019-356	In the discussion, the authors reconcile the inherent contradiction in (i) based on the need of additional downstream tasks that can then benefit from the actionable representation, and as demonstrated in a number of the evaluation examples (at least in the revised version).	rebuttal_process
2019-356	The AC believes in this logic, but believes that this should be stated more clearly in the final paper.	rebuttal_process
2019-356	And it should be explained the extent to which training for auxiliary tasks implicitly solve this problem in any case. <sep>	rebuttal_process

2019-358	This paper presents a novel method for synthesizing fluid simulations, constrained to a set of parameterized variations, <sep>	abstract
2019-358	such as the size and position of a water ball that is dropped.	abstract
2019-358	The results are solid; there is little related work to compare to, in terms of methods that can "compute"/recall simulations at that speed. <sep>	strength
2019-358	The method is 2000x faster than the orginal simulations.	strength
2019-358	This comes with the caveats that: <sep> (a) the results are specific to the given set of parameterized environments; the method is learning a compressed version of the original animations; (b) there is a loss of accuracy, and therefore also a loss of visual plausibility. <sep>	weakness
2019-358	The AC notes that the paper should use the *CONF* format for citations, ie, "(foo et al)" rather than "(19)". <sep>	weakness
2019-358	The AC also suggests that limitations should also be clearly documented, ie, as seen from the perspective of those working in the fluid simulation domain. <sep>	weakness

2019-358	contentious issue relates to the suitability of the paper for the *CONF* audience, <sep>	weakness

2019-358	The AC is of two minds on this: <sep> (i) the fluid simulation domain has different characteristics to other domains, and thu understanding the *CONF* audience can benefit from the specific nature of the predictive problems that come the fluid simulation domain; new problems can drive new methods.	strength
2019-358	There is a loose connection between the given work and residual nets, and of course res-nets have also been recently reconceptualized as PDEs. <sep>	weakness
2019-358	(ii) it's not clear how much the *CONF* audience will get out of the specific solutions being described; <sep>	weakness
2019-358	it requires understanding spatial transformer networks and a number of other domain-specific issues. <sep>	weakness
2019-358	A problem with this type of paper in terms of graphics/SIGGRAPH is that it can also be seen as "falling short" <sep>	weakness
2019-358	there, simply because it is not yet competitive in terms of visual quality or the generality of fluid simulators; it really fulfills a different niche than classical fluid simulators. <sep>	weakness

2019-467	The theory appears to be correct, and the paper reasonably well written.	strength
2019-467	The main concern is in connections to an area of related work that has been omitted, with overly strong statements in the paper that there has been little work for general game dynamics.	weakness
2019-467	This is a serious omission, since it calls into question some of the novelty of the results because they have not been adequately placed relative to this work.	weakness

2019-495	Based on the novel contribution in handling missing feature imputation with VAE, I would recommend to accept the paper.	decision
2019-495	It is worth noticing that there is another submission to *CONF* (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByxLl309Ym) that shares a similar idea of constructing the inference network with binary masking, although it is designed for a pre-trained VAE model. <sep>	misc
2019-495	There are still two weaknesses pointed out by R3 that would help improve the paper by addressing them: <sep> 1. The paper does not handle different kinds of missingness beyond missing at random. <sep>	weakness
2019-495	2. VAE model makes the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. <sep>	weakness

2019-509	After a revision which included various new experiments, the reviewers are generally happy with the paper.	rebuttal_process
2019-509	While there's still some controversy over whether it's really better than things like batch norm, I think the paper would be worth publishing even if the results came out negative, since it is a very natural idea which took some algorithmic insight in order to actually execute.	decision

2019-552	This paper considers the information bottleneck Lagrangian as a tool for studying deep networks in the common case of supervised learning (predicting label Y from features X) with a deterministic model, and identifies a number of troublesome issues.	abstract
2019-552	(1) The information bottleneck curve cannot be recovered by optimizing the Lagrangian for different values of β because in the deterministic case, the IB curve is piecewise linear, not strictly concave.	abstract
2019-552	(2) Uninteresting representations can lie on the IB curve, so information bottleneck optimality does not imply that a representation is useful.	abstract
2019-552	(3) In a multilayer model with a low probability of error, the only tradeoff that successive layers can make between compression and prediction is that deeper layers may compress more.	abstract
2019-552	Experiments on MNIST illustrate these issues, and supplementary material shows that these issues also apply to the deterministic information bottleneck and to stochastic models that are nearly deterministic.	abstract
2019-552	There was a substantial degree of disagreement between the reviewers of this paper.	rating_summary
2019-552	One reviewer (R3) suggested that all the conclusions of the paper are the consequence of P(X,Y) being degenerate.	weakness
2019-552	The authors responded to this criticism in their response and revision quite effectively, in the opinion of the AC.	rebuttal_process
2019-552	Because R3 failed to participate in the discussion, this review has been discounted in the final decision.	rebuttal_process
2019-552	The other two reviewers were considerably more positive about the paper, with one (R1) having basically no criticisms and the other (R2) expression some doubts about the novelty of the observations being made in the paper and their importance for practical machine learning scenarios.	rating_summary
2019-552	Following the revision and discussion, R2 expressed general satisfaction with the paper, so the AC is recommending acceptance.	decision
2019-552	The AC thinks that the final paper would be clearer if the authors were to carefully distinguish between ground-truth labels used in training and the labels estimated by the model for a given input.	suggestion

2019-594	The reviewers and the AC identified a number of potential weaknesses in the presentation in the original submission: (1) there was insufficient background on SOMs, leaving the readers unable to comprehend the contributions, (2) some of the details about the experiments were missing, such as how the baselines were constructed, (3) additional experiments were needed in regards to the hyper-parameters, such as number of clusters and the weighting in the loss, and (4) Figure 4d required a description of the results. <sep>	weakness
2019-594	The revision and the comments by the authors addressed most of these comments, and the reviewers felt that their concerns had been alleviated. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-594	Thus, the reviewers felt the paper should be accepted.	rating_summary

2019-598	The reviewers all agreed that the problem application is interesting, and that there is little new methodology, but disagreed as to how that should translate into a score.	rating_summary
2019-598	The highest rating seemed to heavily weight the importance of the method to biological application, whereas the lowest rating heavily weighted the lack of technical novelty.	rating_summary

2019-651	The overall results are relatively strong. <sep>	strength
2019-651	Overall, the reviewers thought this was a reasonable contribution if somewhat incremental.	strength
2019-651	In addition, while the experimental comparison has greatly improved from the original version, there are still a couple of less satisfying points: notably the size of the training data is somewhat small.	weakness
2019-651	In addition, as far as I can tell all comparisons with other graph-based baselines actually aren't implemented in the same toolkit with the same hyperparameters, so it's a bit difficult to tell whether the gains are coming from the proposed method itself or from other auxiliary differences. <sep>	weakness

2019-707	This paper proposes to quantify the uncertainty of neural network models with Beta, Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood.	abstract
2019-707	This paper is clearly written with a sound main idea.	strength
2019-707	However, it is a common practice to model different types of data with different likelihood, although the proposed distributions are not usually used for network output.	weakness

2019-725	This method proposes a primal approach to minimizing Wasserstein distance for generative models.	abstract
2019-725	It estimates WD by computing the exact WD between empirical distributions. <sep>	abstract

2019-764	This paper focuses on scaling up neural theorem provers, a link prediction system that combines backward chaining with neural embedding of facts, but does not scale to most real-world knowledge bases.	abstract
2019-764	The authors introduce a nearest-neighbor search-based method to reduce the time/space complexity, along with an attention mechanism that improves the training.	abstract
2019-764	With these extensions, they scale NTP to modern benchmarks for the task, including ones that combine text and knowledge bases, thus providing explanations for such models. <sep>	abstract
2019-764	The reviewers and the AC note the following as the primary concerns of the paper: (1) the novelty of the contributions is somewhat limited, as nearest neighbor search and attention are both well-known strategies, as is embedding text+facts jointly, (2) there are several issues in the evaluation, in particular around analysis of benefits of the proposed work on new datasets.	weakness
2019-764	There were a number of other potential weaknesses, such the performance on some benchmarks (Fb15k) and clarity and writing quality of a few sections. <sep>	weakness
2019-764	The authors provided significant revisions to the paper that addressed many of the clarity and evaluation concerns, along with providing sufficient comments to better contextualize some of the concerns.	rebuttal_process

2019-764	Reviewer 4 focused more on the simplicity of the text encoding, which restricts the novelty as more sophisticated text embeddings approaches are commonplace. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-764	Overall, the reviewers raised different concerns, and although all of them appreciated the need for this work and the revisions provided by the authors, ultimately feel that the paper did not quite meet the bar.	decision

2019-774	This paper presents a model for question answering, where the idea is to have a collaborative model that aligns queries and sentences on a small supervised dataset and also uses semi-supervised information from a weakly supervised corpus to answer open domain questions resulting in short answer spans. <sep>	abstract
2019-774	The main criticism of the paper is regarding its novelty, and reviewers cite the similarities with prior work such as Chen et al and Min et al  There is relative consensus between the reviewers that further work using the semi-supervised outlook with stronger results could strengthen the paper further.	weakness

2019-786	The reviewers agreed that there are some promising ideas in this work, and useful empirical analysis to motivate the approach.	strength
2019-786	The main concern is in the soundness of the approach (for example, comments about cumulative learning and negative samples).	weakness
2019-786	The authors provided some justification about using previous networks as initialization, but this is an insufficient discussion to understand the soundness of the strategy.	rebuttal_process
2019-786	The paper should better discuss this more, even if it is not possible to provide theory.	weakness

2019-801	This paper presents an extensive empirical study to sentence-level pre-training.	abstract
2019-801	The paper compares pre-trained language models to other potential alternative pre-training options, and concludes that while pre-trained language models are generally stronger than other alternatives, the robustness and generality of the currently available method is less than ideal, at least with respect to ELMO-based pretraining. <sep>	abstract
2019-801	Pros: <sep> The paper presents an extensive empirical study that offers new insights on pre-trained language models with respect to a variety of sentence-level tasks. <sep>	strength
2019-801	Cons: <sep> The primarily contributions of this paper is empirical and technical novelty is relatively weak.	weakness
2019-801	Also, the insights are based just on ELMO, which may have a relatively weak empirical impact.	weakness
2019-801	The reviews were generally positive but marginally positive, which reflect that insights are interesting but not overwhelmingly interesting.	weakness
2019-801	None of these is a deal-breaker per say, but the paper does not provide sufficiently strong novelty, whether based on insights or otherwise, relative to other papers being considered for acceptance. <sep>	weakness
2019-801	Verdict: <sep> Leaning toward reject due to relatively weak novelty and empirical impact. <sep>	decision
2019-801	Additional note on the final decision: <sep> The insights provided by the paper are valuable, thus the paper was originally recommended for an accept.	strength
2019-801	However, during the calibration process across all areas, it became evident that we cannot accept all valuable papers, each presenting different types of hard work and novel contributions.	misc
2019-801	Consequently, some papers with mostly positive (but marginally positive) reviews could not be included in the final cut, despite their unique values, hard work, and novel contributions.	misc

2019-812	The authors propose using a SVM, trained as a last layer of a neural network, to identify exemplars (support vectors) to save and use to prevent forgetting as the model is trained on further tasks.	abstract
2019-812	The method is effective on several supervised benchmarks and is compared to several other methods, including VCL, iCARL, and GEM.	abstract
2019-812	The reviewers had various objections to the initial paper that centered around comparisons to other methods and reporting of detailed performance numbers, which the authors resolved convincingly in their revised paper.	rebuttal_process
2019-812	However, the AC and 2 of the reviewers were unconvinced of the contribution of the approach.	weakness
2019-812	Although no one has used this particular strategy, of using support vectors to prevent forgetting, the approach is a simplistic composition of the NN and the SVM which is heuristic, at least in how the authors present it.	weakness
2019-812	Most importantly, the approach is limited to supervised classification problems, yet catastrophic forgetting is not commonly considered to be a problem for the supervised classifier setting; rather it is a problem for inherently sequential learning environments such as RL (MNIST and CIFAR are just commonly used in the literature for ease of evaluation).	weakness

2019-837	The paper studies the problem of reinforcement learning under certain constraints on action sequences.	abstract
2019-837	The reviewers raised important concerns regarding (1) the general motivation, (2) the particular formulation of constraints in terms of action sequences and (3) the relevance and significance of experimental results.	rebuttal_process

2019-837	Given the concerns raised by the reviewers, I encourage the authors to improve the paper to possibly resubmit to another venue.	decision

2019-841	The method under consideration uses parallel convolutional filter groups per layer, where activations are averaged between the groups, forming "inner ensembles". <sep>	abstract
2019-841	Reviewers raised a number of concerns, including the increased computational cost for apparently little performance gain, the choice of base architecture (later addressed with additional experiments using WideResNet and ResNeXt), issues of clarity of presentation (some of which were addressed).	weakness
2019-841	One reviewer was unconvinced without direct comparison to full ensembles.	weakness
2019-841	Another reviewer raised the issue of a missing direct comparison to the most similar method in the literature, maxout (Goodfellow et al, 2013).	weakness
2019-841	Authors rebutted this by claiming that maxout is difficult to implement and offering vague arguments for its inferiority to their method. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-841	The AC agrees that a maxout baseline is important here, as it is extremely close to the proposed method and also trivially implemented, and that in light of maxout (and other related methods) the degree of novelty is limited.	weakness
2019-841	The AC also concurs that a full ensemble baseline would strengthen the paper's claims.	weakness
2019-841	In the absence of either of these the AC concurs with the reviewers that this work is not suitable for publication at this time.	decision

2019-842	The authors propose a scheme to learn a mapping between the discrete space of network architectures into a continuous embedding, and from the continuous embedding back into the space of network architectures.	abstract
2019-842	During the training phase, the models regress the number of parameters, and expected accuracy given the continuous embedding.	abstract
2019-842	Once trained, the model can be used for compression by first embedding the network structure and then performing gradient descent to maximize accuracy by minimizing the number of parameters.	abstract
2019-842	The optimized representation can then be mapped back into the discrete architecture space. <sep>	abstract
2019-842	Overall, the main idea of this work is very interesting, and the experiments show that the method has some promise.	strength
2019-842	However, as was noted by the reviewers, the paper could be significantly strengthened by performing additional experiments and analyses.	weakness
2019-842	As such, the AC agrees with the reviewers that the paper in its present form is not suitable for acceptance, but the authors are encouraged to revise and resubmit this work to a future venue.	decision

2019-848	I believe it is valuable to study the errors our models make in order to understand when they work well and how to improve them.	strength
2019-848	Crucially, in the later case, we should demonstrate how to use the errors we find to close the loop and create better models. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	A paper about techniques to find errors for text models should make a sufficiently large contribution to be accepted.	misc
2019-848	I view the following hypothetical contributions as the most salient in this specific case thus my decision reduces to determining if any of these conditions have been met.	misc
2019-848	A paper need not achieve all of these things, any one of them would suffice: <sep> 1. Show that the errors found can be used to meaningfully improve the models. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	This requires building a better model than the one probed by the method and convincingly demonstrating that it is superior in an important way that is relevant to the original goals of the application.	suggestion
2019-848	Ideally it would also consider alternative, simpler ways to improve the models (eg making them larger). <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	2. Show that errors are difficult to find, but that the proposed method is nonetheless capable of finding errors and that the method is non-obvious to a researcher in the field. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	This is not applicable here because errors are extremely easy to find on the test set and from labeling more data.	suggestion
2019-848	If we demand an automated method, then the greedy algorithm does not qualify as sufficiently non-obvious and it seems to work fine, making the Gumbel method unnecessary. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	3. Show that the particular specific errors found are qualitatively different from other errors in their implications and that they provide a unique and important insight. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	I do not believe this submission attempts to show this type of contribution.	weakness
2019-848	One example of this type of paper would be a paper that does a comparative study of the errors that different models make and finds something interesting (potentially yielding a path to improved models). <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	4. Generate a new, more difficult/interesting, dataset by finding errors of one or more trained models <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	Given that the authors use human labelers to validate examples this is potentially another path.	suggestion
2019-848	Here is an example of a paper using adversarial techniques in this way: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05326 <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	However, I believe the paper would need to be rethought and rewritten to make this sort of contribution. <sep>	suggestion
2019-848	Ultimately, the authors and reviews supporting acceptance must explain the contribution succinctly and convincingly.	suggestion
2019-848	The reviewers most strongly advocating for accepting this submission seem to be saying that there is a valuable new method and probabilistic framework proposed here for finding model errors.	strength
2019-848	I believe researchers in the field could have easily come up with the greedy algorithm (a standard approach to discrete optimization problems) proposed here without needing to read the paper.	ac_disagreement
2019-848	Furthermore, I believe the other more complicated Gumbel algorithm proposed is not necessary given the similarly effective and simpler greedy algorithm.	suggestion
2019-848	If the authors believe that the Gumbel algorithm provides application-relevant advantages over the greedy algorithm, then they should specify how these errors will be used and rewrite the paper to make the greedy algorithm a baseline.	suggestion
2019-848	However, I do not believe the experimental results support this idea.	weakness

2019-862	This paper present a framework for creating meaning-preserving adversarial examples.	abstract

2019-875	The authors propose a scheme to compress models using student-teacher distillation, where training data are augmented using examples generated from a conditional GAN. <sep>	abstract
2019-875	The reviewers were generally in agreement that 1) that the experimental results generally support the claims made by the authors, and 2) that the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. <sep>	strength
2019-875	However, the reviewers also raised a number of concerns: 1) that the experiments were conducted on small-scale tasks, 2) the use of the compression score might be impractical since it would require retraining a compressed model, and is affected by the effectiveness of the compression algorithm which is an additional confounding factor.	weakness
2019-875	The authors in their rebuttal address 2) by noting that the student training was not too expensive, but I believe that this cost is task specific.	rebuttal_process
2019-875	Overall, I think 1) is a significant concern, and the AC agrees with the reviewers that an evaluation of the techniques on large-scale datasets would strengthen the paper.	weakness

2019-881	Pros: A potentially interesting idea to drive the search process over a hierachical set of labels using reinforcement learning. <sep>	strength
2019-881	Cons: The major concensus among all reviewers was that there were various concerns about experimental results, eg, apple-to-apple comparisons against prior art (R1), proper tuning of hyper-parameters (R1, R2), the label space is too small (539) to have practical significance compared to tens of thousands of labels that have been used in other related work (R3), and other missing baselines (R3).	weakness
2019-881	In addition, even after the rebuttal, some of the technical clarity issues have not been fully resolved, eg, what the proposed method is actually doing (optimizing F1 metric vs the ability to fix inconsistent labeling problem). <sep>	rebuttal_process

2019-902	AnonReviewer2 particularly argued for acceptance, arguing that the proposed approach provides a very flexible method for incorporating constraints in neural network training.	strength
2019-902	A concern of AnonReviewer2 was that there was no guarantee that this loss would be convex or converge to an optimum while statisfying the constraints.	weakness
2019-902	The other two reviewers unfortunately felt that while the proposed approach was "interesting", "promising" and "intriguing", the quality of the paper, in terms of exposition, was too low to justify acceptance.	weakness

2019-993	Overall, it sounds like a good engineering paper that might be better fit to computer vision venue, but experimental validation seems somewhat preliminary and it's unclear how much novel insight and general technical contributions that this work provides.	weakness

2019-1000	The authors propose a GAN-based anomaly detection method based on simulating anomalies (low density regions of the data space) in order to train an anomaly classifier. <sep>	abstract
2019-1000	While the paper addresses an interesting take on an important problem, there are many concerns raised by reviewers including novelty, clarity, attribution, reproducibility, the use of exclusively proprietary data, and a multitude of textual mistakes.	weakness
2019-1000	Overall, the paper shows promise but does not seem to be a mature and polished piece of work.	weakness

2019-1020	This paper provides further insight into using RL for active learning, particularly by formulating AL as an MDP and then using RL methods for that MDP.	abstract
2019-1020	Though the paper has a few insights, it does not sufficiently place itself amongst the many other similar strategies using an MDP formulation.	weakness
2019-1020	I recommend better highlighting what is novel in this work (eg, more focus on the reward function, if that is key).	suggestion

2019-1026	The authors propose a framework for compressing neural network models which involves applying a weight distortion function periodically as part of training.	abstract
2019-1026	The proposed approach is relatively simple to implement, and is shown to work for weight pruning, low-rank compression and quantization, without sacrificing accuracy. <sep>	strength
2019-1026	However, the reviewers had a number of concerns about the work.	misc
2019-1026	Broadly, the reviewers felt that the work was incremental.	weakness

2019-1028	This paper presents a new defense against adversarial examples using random permutations and a Fourier transform.	abstract
2019-1028	The technique is clearly novel, and the paper is clearly written. <sep>	strength
2019-1028	However, as the reviewers and commenters pointed out, there is a significant degradation in natural accuracy, which does not seem to be easily recoverable.	weakness
2019-1028	This degradation is due to the random permutation of the images, which effectively disallows the use of convolutions. <sep>	weakness
2019-1028	Furthermore, Reviewer 1 points out that the baselines are insufficient, as the authors do not explore (a) learning the transformation, or (b) using expectation over transformation to attack the model. <sep>	weakness
2019-1028	This concern is further validated by the fact that Black-box attacks are often the best-performing, which is a sign of gradient masking.	weakness
2019-1028	The authors try to address this by performing an attack against an ensemble of models, and against a substitute model attack.	rebuttal_process
2019-1028	However, attacking an ensemble is not equivalent to optimizing the expectation, which would require sampling a new permutation at each step. <sep>	rebuttal_process

2019-1034	However, it's not clear there is a substantial enough contribution for an *CONF* paper.	weakness
2019-1034	The idea of subsampling is fairly obvious, and various other methods have already been proposed which decouple the computation of BN statistics from the training batch.	weakness

2019-1098	However reviews opined that the setting considered in this paper is too specific to this XOR problem and the simplified network architecture,  and the techniques are not generalizable to other models.	weakness
2019-1098	Generalizing these results to more complex architectures or other learning problems will make the paper more interesting.	suggestion

2019-1120	The reviewers raised a number of concerns including the usefulness of the presented dataset given that the collected data is acted rather than naturalistic (and the large body of research in affective computing explains that models trained on acted data cannot generalise to naturalistic data), no methodological novelty in the presented work, and relatively uninteresting application with very limited real-world application (it remains unclear whether having better empathetic dialogues would be truly crucial for any real-life application and, in addition, all work is based on acted rather than real-world data).	weakness
2019-1120	The authors' rebuttal addressed some of the reviewers' concerns but not fully (especially when it comes to usefulness of the data).	rebuttal_process

2019-1214	This was a borderline paper and a very difficult decision to make. <sep>	misc
2019-1214	The paper addresses a potentially interesting problem in approximate POMDP planning, based on simplifying assumptions that perception can be decoupled from action and that a set of sensors exhibits certain conditional independence structure.	abstract
2019-1214	As a result, a simple approach can be devised that incorporates a simple greedy perception method within a point-based value iteration scheme. <sep>	abstract
2019-1214	Unfortunately, the assumptions the paper makes are so strong and seemingly artificial to the extent that they appear reverse engineered to the use of a simple perception heuristic.	weakness
2019-1214	In principle, such a simplification might not be a problem if the resulting formulation captured practically important scenarios, but that was not convincingly achieved in this paper---indeed, another major limitation of the paper is its weak motivation.	weakness
2019-1214	In more detail, the proposed approach relies on decoupling of perception and action, which is a restrictive assumption that bypasses the core issue of exploration versus exploitation in POMDPS.	weakness
2019-1214	As model of active perception, the proposal is simplistic and somewhat artificial; the motivation for the particular cost model (cardinality of the sensor set) is particularly weak---a point that was not convincingly defended in the discussion.	weakness
2019-1214	Perhaps the biggest underlying weakness is the experimental evaluation, which is inadequate to support a claim that the proposed methods show meaningful advantages over state-of-the-art approaches in important scenarios.	weakness
2019-1214	A reviewer also raised legitimate questions about the strength of the theoretical analysis. <sep>	weakness

2019-1214	In the end, my judgement is that the paper is not yet strong enough for publication.	decision
2019-1214	I would recommend the authors significantly strengthen the experimental evaluation to cover off at least two of the major shortcomings of the current paper: (1) The true utility of the proposed method needs to be better established against stronger baselines in more realistic scenarios.	suggestion
2019-1214	(2) The relevance of the restrictive assumptions needs to be more convincingly established by providing concrete, realistic and more challenging case studies where the proposed techniques are still applicable.	suggestion

2019-1247	* Strengths <sep> The paper proposes a novel and interesting method for detecting adversarial examples, which has the advantage of being based on general "fingerprint statistics" of a model and is not restricted to any specific threat model (in contrast to much of the work in the area which is restricted to adversarial examples in some L_p norm ball).	strength
2019-1247	The writing is clear and the experiments are extensive. <sep>	strength
2019-1247	* Weaknesses <sep> The experiments are thorough.	weakness
2019-1247	However, they contain a subtle but important flaw.	weakness
2019-1247	During discussion it was revealed that the attacks used to evaluate the method fail to reduce accuracy even at large values of epsilon where there are simple adversarial attacks that should reduce the accuracy to zero.	weakness
2019-1247	This casts doubt on whether the attacks at small values of epsilon really are providing a good measure of the method's robustness. <sep>	weakness
2019-1247	* Discussion <sep> There was substantial disagreement about the paper, with R1 feeling that the evaluation issues were serious enough to merit rejection and R3 feeling that they were not a large issue.	rating_summary
2019-1247	In discussion with me, both R1 and R3 agreed that if an attack were demonstrated to break the method, that would be grounds for rejection.	rating_summary
2019-1247	They also both agreed that there probably is an attack that breaks the method.	rating_summary
2019-1247	A potential key difference is that R3 thinks this might be quite difficult to find and so merits publishing the paper to motivate stronger attacks. <sep>	rating_summary
2019-1247	I ultimately agree with R1 that the evaluation issues are indeed serious.	weakness
2019-1247	One reason for this is that there is by now a long record of adversarial defense papers posting impressive numbers that are often invalidated within a short period (often less than a month or so) of the paper being published.	weakness
2019-1247	The "Obfuscated Gradients" paper of Athalye, Carlini, and Wagner suggests several basic sanity checks to help avoid this.	weakness
2019-1247	One of the sanity checks (which the present paper fails) is to test that attacks work when epsilon is large.	weakness
2019-1247	This is not an arbitrary test but gets at a key issue---any given attack provides only an *upper bound* on the worst-case accuracy of a method.	weakness
2019-1247	For instance, if an attack only brings the accuracy of a method down to 80% at epsilon=1 (when we know the true accuracy should be 0%), then at epsilon=0.01 we know that the measured accuracy of the attack comes 80% from the over-optimistic accuracy at epsilon=1 and at most 20% from the true accuracy at epsilon=0.01.	weakness
2019-1247	If the measured accuracy at epsilon=1 is close to 100%, then accuracy at lower values of epsilon provides basically no information.	weakness
2019-1247	This means that the experiments as currently performed give no information about the true accuracy of the method, which is a serious issue that the authors should address before the paper can be accepted.	decision

2019-1268	The submission proposes a setting of two agents, one of them probing the other (the latter being the "demonstrator").	abstract
2019-1268	The probing is done in a way that learns to imitate the expert's behavior, with some curiosity-driven reward that maximizes the chance that the probing agents has the expert do trajectories that the probing agent hasn't seen before. <sep>	abstract
2019-1268	All the reviewers found the idea and experiments interesting.	strength
2019-1268	The major concern is whether the setup and the environments are too contrived.	weakness
2019-1268	At least 2 reviewers commented on the fact that the environments/dataset seemed engineered for success of the given method, which is a concern about how this method would generalize to something other than the proposed setup. <sep>	weakness
2019-1268	I also share the concern with R3 regarding the practicality of the proposed method: it is not obvious to me what problems this would actually be *useful* for, given that the method requires online interaction with an expert agent in order to succeed.	weakness
2019-1268	The space of such scenarios where we can continuously probe an expert agent many many times for free/cheap is very small and frankly I'm not entirely sure why you would need to do imitation learning in that case at all (if the method was shown to work using only a state, rather than requiring a state/action pair from the expert, then maybe it'd be more useful). <sep>	weakness
2019-1268	It's a tough call, but despite the nice results and interesting ideas, I think the method lacks generality and practical utility/significance and thus at this point I cannot recommend acceptance in its current form.	decision

2019-1339	One of the main concerns of the method's effectiveness in practice is the computational cost.	weakness
2019-1339	There is also concern from one of the reviewers that the formulation could result in creating sparse matching maps where only a few pixels get matched.	weakness
2019-1339	The authors provide some justification for why this wouldn't happen, and this should be put in a future draft.	rebuttal_process
2019-1339	Even better would be to show statistics to demonstrate empirically that this doesn't happen. <sep>	suggestion
2019-1339	There were a number of clarifications that were brought up during the discussion, and the authors should go over this carefully and update the draft to resolve these issues.	rebuttal_process
2019-1339	There is also a typo in the title that should be fixed.	weakness

2019-1362	The authors propose implementing intrinsic motivation as a differentiable supervised loss coming from the error of a forward model, rather than the black box style of curiosity reward.	abstract
2019-1362	The motivation is that this approach will lead to more sample efficient exploration for real robots.	abstract
2019-1362	The use of a differentiable loss for policy optimization is interesting and has some novelty.	strength
2019-1362	However, the reviewers were unanimous in their criticism of the paper for poor baselines, unclear experiments and results, and unsupported claims.	weakness

2019-1368	This paper proposes TopicGAN, a generative adversarial approach to topic modeling and text generation.	abstract
2019-1368	TopicGAN operates in two steps: it first generates latent topics and produces bag-of-words corresponding to those latent topics.	abstract
2019-1368	In the second step, the model generates text conditioning on those topic words. <sep>	abstract
2019-1368	Pros: <sep> It combines the strength of topic models (interpretable topics that are learned unsupervised) with GAN for text generation. <sep>	strength
2019-1368	Cons: <sep> There are three major concerns raised by reviewers: (1) clarity, (2) relatively thin experimental results, and (3) novelty.	weakness
2019-1368	Of these, the first two were the main concerns.	weakness
2019-1368	In particular, R1 and R2 raised concerns about insufficient component-wise evaluation (eg, text classification from topic models) and insufficient GAN-based baselines.	weakness
2019-1368	Also, the topic model part of TopicGAN seems somewhat underdeveloped in that the model assumes a single topic per document, which is a relatively strong simplifying assumption compared to most other topic models (R1, R3).	weakness
2019-1368	The technical novelty is not extremely strong in that the proposed model combines existing components together.	weakness
2019-1368	But this alone would have not been a deal breaker if the empirical results were rigorous and strong. <sep>	weakness
2019-1368	Verdict: <sep> Reject.	decision
2019-1368	Many technical details require clarification and experiments lack sufficient comparisons against prior art.	weakness

2019-1378	This work proposes to use the MAML meta-learning approach in order to tackle the typical problem of insufficient demonstrations in IRL. <sep>	abstract
2019-1378	All reviewers found this work to contain a novel and well-motivated idea and the manuscript to be well-written.	strength
2019-1378	The combination of MAML and MaxEnt IRL is straightforward, as R2 points out, however the AC does not consider this to be a flaw given that the main novelty here is the high-level idea rather than the technical details. <sep>	ac_disagreement
2019-1378	However, all reviewers agree that for this paper to meet the *CONF* standards, there has to be an increase in rigorousness through (a) a more close examination of assumptions, sensitivity of parameters and connections to imitation learning (b) expanding the experimental section.	suggestion

2019-1414	This is an interesting direction but multiple reviewers had concerns about the amount of novelty in the current work, and given the strong pool of other papers, this didn't quite reach the threshold.	decision

2019-1424	The paper proposes adversarial sampling for pool-based active learning. <sep>	abstract
2019-1424	The reviewers and AC note the critical potential weaknesses on experimental results: it is far from being surprising the proposed method is better than random sampling.	weakness
2019-1424	Ideally, one has to reduce the complexity under keeping the state-of-art performance.	weakness
2019-1424	Otherwise, it is hard to claim the proposed method is fundamentally better than prior ones, although their targets might be different. <sep>	weakness
2019-1424	AC thinks the proposed method has potential and is interesting, but decided that the authors need more works to publish.	decision

2019-1432	I enjoyed reading the paper myself and I appreciate the unifying framework connecting RAML and SPG.	misc
2019-1432	While I do not put a lot of weight on the experiments, I agree with the reviewers that the experimental results are not very strong, and I am not convinced that the theoretical contribution meets the bar at *CONF*. <sep>	weakness
2019-1432	In the interpolation algorithm, there seems to be an additional annealing parameter and two tuning parameters.	weakness
2019-1432	It is important to describe how the parameters are tuned.	weakness
2019-1432	Given the additional hyper-parameters, one may consider giving all of the algorithms the same budget of hyper-parameter tuning.	suggestion
2019-1432	I also agree with reviewers that the policy gradient baseline seems to underperform typical results.	weakness
2019-1432	One possible way to strengthen the experiments is to try to replicate the results of SPG or RAML and discuss the behavior of each algorithm as a function of hyper-parameters.	suggestion

2019-1434	This paper does two things.	abstract
2019-1434	First, it proposes an approach to estimating the mutual information between the input, X, or target label, Y, and an internal representation in a deep neural network, L, using MINE (for I(Y;L)) or a variation on MINE (for I(X;L)) and noise regularization (estimating I(X;L+ε), where ε is isotropic Gaussian white noise) to avoid the problem that I(X;L) is infinite for deterministic networks and continuous X.	abstract
2019-1434	Second, it attempts to validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015) by exploring an approach to training DNNs that optimizes the information bottleneck Lagrangian, I(Y;L) − βI(X;L+ε), layerwise instead of using cross-entropy and backpropagation.	abstract
2019-1434	Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show improvements for the layerwise training over cross-entropy training.	abstract
2019-1434	The penalty on I(X;L+ε) is described as being analogous to weight decay.	abstract
2019-1434	The reviewers raised a number of concerns about the paper, the most serious of which is that the claim that the layerwise training results validate the information bottleneck theory of deep learning is too strong.	weakness
2019-1434	In the AC's opinion, R1's critique that "[i]f the true mutual information is infinite and the noise regularized estimator is only meant for comparative purposes, why then are the results of the training trajectories interpreted so literally as estimates of the true mutual information?"	rebuttal_process
2019-1434	is critical, and the authors' reply that "this quantity is in fact a more appropriate measure for "compactness" or "complexity" than the mutual information itself" undermines their claim that they are validating the information bottleneck theory of deep nets because the information bottleneck theory claims to be using mutual information.	rebuttal_process
2019-1434	The AC also suggests that if the authors wish to continue this work and submit it to another venue, they (1) discuss the fact that MINE estimates only a lower bound that may be quite loose in practice and (2) say in their experimental section whether or not the variance of the regularizing noise was tuned as a hyperparameter, and if so, how results varied with different amounts of noise.	suggestion
2019-1434	Finally, the AC regrets that only one reviewer participated in the discussion (in a very minimal way), despite the reviewers' receiving several reminders that the discussion is a defining feature of the *CONF* review process.	rebuttal_process

2019-1440	All reviewers agree in their assessment that this paper has merits but is not yet ready for acceptance into *CONF*.	rating_summary
2019-1440	The area chair commends the authors for their responses to the reviews.	rebuttal_process

2019-1446	This paper presents a dataset for measuring disentanglement in learned representations.	abstract
2019-1446	It consists of MNIST digits, sometimes transformed in various ways, and labeled with a variety of attributes.	abstract
2019-1446	This dataset is used to measure statistics of various learned models. <sep>	abstract
2019-1446	Measuring disentanglement is certainly an important problem in our field.	strength
2019-1446	This dataset seems to be well designed, and I would recommend its use for papers studying disentanglement.	strength
2019-1446	The experiments are well-designed.	strength
2019-1446	While the reviewers seem bothered by the fact that it's limited to MNIST, this doesn't strike me as a problem.	ac_disagreement
2019-1446	We continue to learn a lot from MNIST, even today. <sep>	ac_disagreement
2019-1446	But producing a useful dataset isn't by itself a significant enough research contribution for an *CONF* paper.	weakness
2019-1446	I'd recommend publication if (a) it were very different from currently existing datasets, (b) constructing it required overcoming significant technical obstacles, or (c) the dataset led to particularly interesting findings. <sep>	misc
2019-1446	Regarding (a), there are already datasets of similar complexity which have ground-truth attributes useful for measuring disentanglement, such as dSprites and 3D Faces.	weakness
2019-1446	Regarding (b), the construction seems technically straightforward.	weakness
2019-1446	Regarding (c), the experimental findings are plausible and consistent with past findings (which is a good validation of the dataset) but not obviously interesting in their own right. <sep>	weakness
2019-1446	So overall, this seems like a useful dataset, but I cannot recommend publication at *CONF*.	decision

2019-1448	This paper studies the properties of L1 regularization for deep neural network.	abstract
2019-1448	It contains some interesting results, eg the stationary point of an l1 regularized layer has bounded number of non-zero elements.	strength
2019-1448	On the other hand, the majority of reviewers has concerns on that experimental supports are weak and suggests rejection.	rating_summary
2019-1448	Therefore, a final rejection is proposed.	decision

2019-1458	The authors propose a technique for pruning networks by using second-order information through the Hessian.	abstract
2019-1458	The Hessian is approximated using the Fisher Information Matrix, which is itself approximated using KFAC.	abstract
2019-1458	The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, and is evaluated on a number of systems where the authors find that the proposed method achieves good compression ratios without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. <sep>	strength
2019-1458	The reviewers raised concerns about 1) the novelty of the work (which builds on the KFAC work of Martens and Grosse), 2) whether zeroing out individual connections as opposed to neurons will have practical runtime benefits, 3) the lack of comparisons against baselines on overall training time/complexity, 4) comparisons to work which directly prune as part of training (instead of the train-prune-finetune scheme adopted by the authors). <sep>	weakness
2019-1458	In the view of the AC,  4) would be an interesting comparison but was not critical to the decision.	ac_disagreement
2019-1458	Ultimately, the decision came down to the concern of lack of novelty and whether the proposed techniques would have an impact on runtime in practice.	weakness

2019-1468	This paper tackles the problem of using auxiliary losses to help regularize and aid the learning of a "goal" task.	abstract
2019-1468	The approach proposes avoiding the learning of irrelevant or contradictory details from the auxiliary task at the expense of the "goal" tasks by observing cosine similarity between the auxiliary and main tasks and ignore those gradients which are too dissimilar. <sep>	abstract
2019-1468	To justify such a setup one must first show that such negative interference occurs in practice, warranting explicit attention.	suggestion
2019-1468	Then one must show that their algorithm effectively mitigates this interference and at the same time provides some useful signal in combination with the main learning objective. <sep>	suggestion
2019-1468	During the review process there was a significant discussion as to whether the proposed approach sufficiently justified its need and usefulness as defined above.	misc
2019-1468	One major point of contention is whether to compare against the multi-task literature.	rebuttal_process
2019-1468	The authors claim that prior multi-task learning literature is out of scope of this work since their goal is not to measure performance on all tasks used during learning.	rebuttal_process
2019-1468	However, this claim does not invalidate the reviewer's request for comparison against multi-task learning work.	rebuttal_process
2019-1468	In fact, the authors *should* verify that their method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods.	suggestion
2019-1468	Not because they too are studying performance across all tasks, but because their method which knows to prioritize one task during training should certainly outperform the learning paradigms which have no special preference to one of the tasks. <sep>	suggestion
2019-1468	A main issue with the current draft centers around the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.	weakness
2019-1468	First, whether the gradient co-sine similarity is a necessary condition to avoid negative interference and 2) to show at least empirically that auxiliary losses do offer improved performance over optimizing the goal task alone.	weakness
2019-1468	Based on the experiments now available the answers to these questions remains unclear and thus the paper is not yet recommended for publication.	decision

2019-1474	The paper proposes a new method for training generative models by minimizing general f-divergences.	abstract
2019-1474	The main technical idea is to optimize f-divergence between joint distributions which is rightly observed to be the upper bound of the f-divergence between the marginal distributions and address the disjoint support problem by convolving the data with a noise distribution.	abstract
2019-1474	The basic ideas in this work are not completely novel but are put together in a new way. <sep>	strength
2019-1474	However, the key weakness of this work, as all the reviewer noticed, is that the empirical results are too week to support the usefulness of the proposed approach.	weakness
2019-1474	The only quantitive results are in table 2, which is only a simple Gaussian example.	weakness
2019-1474	It essential to have more substantial empirical results for supporting the new algorithm.	suggestion

2019-1536	The paper contains useful information and shows relative improvements compared to mixup.	strength

2019-1565	This paper shows convergence of stochastic gradient descent  for the problem of learning weight matrices for a linear dynamical system  with non-linear activation.	abstract
2019-1565	Reviewers agree that the problem considered is both interesting and challenging.	strength
2019-1565	However the paper makes many simplifying assumptions - 1) both input and hidden state are observed, a very non standard assumption, 2) analysis requires increasing activation functions, cannot handle ReLU functions.	weakness
2019-1565	I agree with R2 and think these assumptions make the results significantly weaker.	weakness
2019-1565	R1 and R3 are more optimistic, but authors response does not give an insight into how one might extend this analysis to the setting where hidden state is not observed.	rebuttal_process
2019-1565	Relaxing these assumptions will make the paper more interesting.	suggestion

2019-1571	The paper proposes two simple generator architecture variants enabling the use of GAN training for the tasks of denoising (from known noise types) and demixing (of two added sources).	abstract
2019-1571	While the denoising approach is very similar to AmbientGAN and could thus be considered somewhat incremental, all reviewers and the AC agree that the developed use of GANs for demixing is an interesting novel direction.	strength
2019-1571	The paper is well written, and the approach is supported by encouraging experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. <sep>	strength
2019-1571	Reviewers and AC noted the following weaknesses of the paper: a) no theoretical support or analysis is provided for the approach, this makes it primarily an empirical study of a nice idea. <sep>	weakness
2019-1571	b) For an empirical study, the experimental evaluation is very limited, both in terms of dataset/problems it is tested on; and in terms of algorithms for demixing/source-separation that it is compared against. <sep>	weakness
2019-1571	Following these reviews, the authors added the experiments on Fashion-MNIST and comparison with ICA which are steps in the right direction.	rebuttal_process
2019-1571	This improvement moved one reviewer to positively update his score, but not the others. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2019-1571	Taking everything into account, the AC judges that it is a very promising direction, but that more extensive experiments on additional benchmark tasks for demixing and comparison with other demixing algorithms are needed to make this work a more complete contribution.	suggestion

2019-1598	The paper tried to introduce a new interpretation of dropout and come with improved algorithms.	abstract

2019-1603	This paper shows how to implement a low-rank version of the Adagrad preconditioner in a GPU-friendly manner.	abstract
2019-1603	A theoretical analysis of a "hard-window" version of the proposed algorithm demonstrates that it is not worse than SGD at finding a first-order stationary point in the nonconvex setting.	abstract
2019-1603	Experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using a ConvNet and Penn Treebank character-level language modeling using an LSTM show that the proposed algorithm improves training loss faster than SGD, Adagrad, and Adam (measuring time in epochs) and has better generalization performance on the language modeling task.	abstract
2019-1603	However, if wall-clock time is used to measure time, there is no speedup for the ConvNet model, but there is for the recurrent model.	abstract
2019-1603	The reviewers liked the simplicity of the approach and greatly appreciated the elegant visualization of the eigenspectrum in Figure 4.	strength
2019-1603	But, even after discussion, critical concerns remained about the need for more focus on the practical tradeoffs between per-iteration improvement and per-second improvement in the loss and the need for a more careful analysis of the relationship of this method to stochastic L-BFGS.	rebuttal_process
2019-1603	A more minor concern is that the term "full-matrix regularization" seems somewhat deceptive when the actual regularization is low rank.	weakness
2019-1603	The AC also suggests that, if the authors plan to revise this paper and submit it to another venue, they consider the relationship between GGT and the various stochastic natural gradient optimization algorithms in the literature that differ from GGT primarily in the exponent on the Gram matrix.	suggestion

2019-1624	The work proposes a method for smoothing a non-differentiable machine learning pipeline (such as the Faster-RCNN detector) using policy gradient.	abstract

2019-1638	The authors propose a generative model based on variational autoencoders that provides means to manipulate the high-level attributes of a given input.	abstract
2019-1638	The attributes can be either pre-defined ground truth attributes or unknown attributes automatically discovered from the data. <sep>	abstract
2019-1638	While the reviewers acknowledged the potential usefulness of the proposed approach, they raised important concerns that were viewed by AC as a critical issue: (1) very limited experimental evaluation (eg no baseline or ablation results, no quantitative results); comparisons on other more complex datasets and more in-depth analysis would substantially strengthen the evaluation and would allow to assess the scope of the contribution of this work  – see, for example, R3's suggestion to use other dataset like dSprites or CelebA, where the ground truth attributes are known; (2) lack of presentation clarity – see R2's latest comment how to improve. <sep>	weakness
2019-1638	A general consensus among reviewers and AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication.	decision

2019-1650	The reviewers and ACs note weakness in the evaluation of the proposed method.	weakness
2019-1650	In particular, reviewers note that the Parzen-based log-likelihood estimate is known to be unreliable in high-dimensions.	weakness
2019-1650	This makes a quantitative evaluation of the results challenging, thus other metrics should be evaluated.	weakness

2019-1686	In particular, the first contribution, which is the main aspect of the proposal is effective, outperforming methods for fully unsupervised learning. <sep>	strength
2019-1686	The main concern with the proposed method, or at least it's description in the paper, is that it isn't framed appropriately with respect to previous work on mining parallel sentences from comparable corpora such as Wikipedia.	weakness
2019-1686	Based on interaction in the reviews, I feel that things are now framed a bit better, and there are additional baselines, but still the explanation in the paper isn't framed with respect to this previous work, and also the baselines are not competitive, despite previous work reporting very nice results for these previous methods. <sep>	weakness
2019-1686	I feel like this could be a very nice paper at some point if it's re-written with the appropriate references to previous work, and experimental results where the baselines are done appropriately.	suggestion

2020-734	The difference compared to Ren et al (cited) is that the IW function is non-differentiable and optimized using Reinforcement Learning. <sep>	abstract
2020-734	A first concern (Rev#1, Rev#2) regards the positioning of the paper wrt RL, as the actual optimization method could be any black-box optimization method: one wants to find the IW that maximizes the faithfulness.	rebuttal_process

2020-794	Thanks to reviewers and authors for an interesting discussion.	misc

2020-794	The paper, however, inspired an interesting discussion, and I would encourage the authors to continue this line of work, addressing the question of bias and overfitting more directly, possibly going beyond dataset evaluation and, for example, thinking about how to evaluate whether training on non-isomorphic graphs leads to better off-training set generalization.	suggestion

2020-883	I believe the actual criticism being made is that the value of these new results do not go above and beyond existing ones.	weakness
2020-883	There is also the matter of what value should be attributed to technical developments on their own.	weakness

2020-894	This paper proposes to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by encouraging distribution matching in the latent space.	abstract
2020-894	Reviewers 1 and 3 expressed concerns that the methodology is too incremental in the context of the existing literature (VEEGAN, VAE-GAN, AAE).	weakness
2020-894	This, combined with the lack of up-to-date baselines, makes it difficult to access the significance of the proposed modifications.	weakness

2020-897	This paper presents sparse attention mechanisms for image captioning.	abstract
2020-897	In addition to recent sparsemax based method, authors proposed to extend it by incorporating structural constraints in 2D images, which is called TVMAX.	abstract
2020-897	The proposed methods are shown to improve the quality of captioning, particularly in terms of fewer erroneous repetitions, and obtain better human evaluation scores. <sep>	abstract
2020-897	Through reviewer discussion, one reviewer updated the score to rejection.	rating_summary
2020-897	A major concern raised by the reviewers is that the motivation of introducing sparse attention is not clear, and the reason why it improves the quality (particularly, why it can reduce repetition) is not convincing.	weakness
2020-897	While we understand it is plausible for long sequences as in text domain, we are not convinced that it is really necessary for image captioning problems.	weakness
2020-897	Although authors seem to have some ideas, we cannot see how they will be reflected in the paper so I'd like to recommend rejection. <sep>	decision
2020-897	I recommend authors to polish the paper with a clearer description of the motivation and high-level analysis of the method as well as testing on other visual tasks to show its generality.	suggestion

2020-899	This paper proposes augmentation of the state exploration strategy that is interesting and has a potential to lead to improvement.	abstract
2020-899	However, the current presentation makes it difficult to properly assess that.	weakness

2020-916	The paper proposes a domain-adaptive filter decomposition method via separating domain-specific and cross-domain features, towards learning invariant representations for unsupervised domain adaptation. <sep>	abstract
2020-916	Overall, this well-written paper is well motivated with a better technique for learning invariant representations using convolutional filters.	strength
2020-916	Nonetheless, reviewers still have major concerns: 1) the novelty of the paper may be marginal given the significant line of recent work on learning domain-invariant representations; 2) when the label distributions differ, learning invariant representations can only lead to worse target generalizations; 3) the provided theory has an unclear connection to the presented filter decomposition method.	weakness
2020-916	The paper can be strengthened by further discussions on how to mitigate the aforementioned negative results. <sep>	suggestion
2020-916	Hence I recommend rejection.	decision

2020-949	This work claims two primary contributions: first a new saliency method "expected gradients" is proposed, and second the authors propose the idea of attribution priors to improve model performance by integrating domain knowledge during training.	abstract
2020-949	Reviewers agreed that the expected gradients method is interesting and novel, and experiments such as Table 1 are a good starting point to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method.	strength
2020-949	However, the claimed "novel framework, attribution priors" has large overlap with prior work [1].	weakness
2020-949	One suggestion for improving the paper is to revise the introduction and experiments to support the claim "expected gradients improve model explainability and yield effective attribution priors" rather than claiming to introduce attribution priors as a new framework.	suggestion
2020-949	One possibility for strengthening this claim is to revisit experiments in [1] and related follow-up work to demonstrate that expected gradients yield improvements over existing saliency methods.	suggestion
2020-949	Additionally, current experiments in Table 1 only consider integrated gradients as a baseline saliency method, there are many others worth considering, see for example the suite of methods explored in [2]. <sep>	suggestion
2020-949	Finally, I would add that the current section on distribution shift provides an overly narrow perspective on model robustness by only considering robustness to additive Gaussian noise.	weakness
2020-949	It is known that it is easy to improve robustness to Gaussian noise by biasing the model towards low frequency statistics in the data, however this typically results in degraded robustness to other kinds of noise types.	weakness
2020-949	See for example [3], where it was observed that adversarial training degrades model robustness to low frequency noise and the fog corruption.	weakness
2020-949	If the authors wish to pursue using attribution priors for improving robustness to distribution shift, it is important that they evaluate on a more varied suite of corruptions/noise types [4].	suggestion
2020-949	Additionally, one should compare against strong baselines in this area [5]. <sep>	suggestion

2020-1033	The paper proposed a new metric to define the quality of optimizers as a weighted average of the scores reached after a certain number of hyperparameters have been tested. <sep>	abstract
2020-1033	While reviewers (and myself) understood the need to better be able to compare optimizers, they failed to be convinced by the proposed solutions.	weakness
2020-1033	In particular (setting aside several complaints of the reviewers with which I disagree), by defining a very versatile metric, this paper lacks a strong conclusion as the ranking of optimizers would clearly depend on the instantiation of that metric. <sep>	weakness
2020-1033	Although that is to be expected, by the very behaviour of these optimizers, it makes it unclear what the added value of the metric is.	weakness
2020-1033	As one reviewer pointed out,  all the points made could have been similarly made with other, more common plots. <sep>	weakness

2020-1056	This paper interprets adaptive gradient methods as trust region methods, and then extends the trust regions to axis-aligned ellipsoids determined by the approximate curvature.	abstract
2020-1056	It's fairly natural to try to extend the algorithms in this way, but the paper doesn't show much evidence that this is actually effective.	weakness
2020-1056	(The experiments show an improvement only in terms of iterations, which doesn't account for the computational cost or the increased batch size; there doesn't seem to be an improvement in terms of epochs.)	weakness
2020-1056	I suspect the second-order version might also lose some of the online convex optimization guarantees of the original methods, raising the question of whether the trust-region interpretation really captures the benefits of the original methods.	weakness

2020-1092	The paper proposes to combine RL and Imitation Learning.	abstract
2020-1092	It defines a regularized reward function that minimizes the KL distance between the policy and the expert action.	abstract
2020-1092	The formulation is similar to the KL regularized MDPs, but with the difference that an additional indicator function based on the support of the expert's distribution is multiplied to the regularized term. <sep>	abstract
2020-1092	Several issues have been brought up by the reviewers, including: <sep> * Comparison with pre-deep learning literature on the combination of RL and imitation learning <sep>	weakness
2020-1092	* Similarity to regularized MDP framework <sep>	weakness
2020-1092	* Assumption 1 requiring a stochastic expert policy, contradicting the policy invariance claim <sep>	weakness
2020-1092	* Difficulty of learning the indicator function of the support of the expert's data distribution <sep>	weakness
2020-1092	Some of these issues have been addressed, but at the end of the day, one of the expert reviewers was not convinced that the problem of learning an indicator function is going to be easy at all.	rebuttal_process
2020-1092	The reviewer believes that learning such a function requires "learning a harsh approximation of the density of visits of the expert for every state which is a quite hard task, especially in stochastic environments." <sep>	rebuttal_process
2020-1092	Another issue is related to the policy invariance under the optimal expert policy.	weakness
2020-1092	In most MDPs, the optimal policy is not stochastic and does not satisfy Assumption 1, so the optimal policy invariance proof seems to contradict Assumption 1. <sep>	weakness

2020-1111	This paper presents a new link prediction framework in the case of small amount labels using meta learning methods.	abstract
2020-1111	The reviewers think the problem is important, and the proposed approach is a modification of meta learning to this case.	strength
2020-1111	However, the method is not compared to other knowledge graph completion methods such as TransE, RotaE, Neural Tensor Factorization in benchmark dataset such as Fb15k and freebase.	weakness
2020-1111	Adding these comparisons can make the paper more convincing.	suggestion

2020-1114	This paper presents a method which creates a representative subset of testing examples so that the model can be tested quickly during the training.	abstract
2020-1114	The procedure makes use of the famous HGS selection algorithm which identifies and then eliminates the redundant and obsolete test cases based on two criteria: (1) structural coverage as measured by the number of neurons activated beyond a certain threshold, and (2) distribution mismatch (as measured by KL divergence) of the last layer activations.	abstract
2020-1114	The algorithm has two-phases: (1) a greedy subset selection based on the coverage, and (2) an iterative phase were additional test examples are added until the KL divergence (as defined above) falls below some threshold. <sep>	abstract
2020-1114	This approach is incremental in nature -- the resulting multi-objective optimisation problem is not a significant improvement over BOT.	weakness
2020-1114	After the discussion phase, we believe that the advantages over BOT were not clearly demonstrated and that the main drawback of BOT (requiring the number of samples) is not hindering practical applications.	rebuttal_process
2020-1114	Finally, the empirical evaluation is performed on very small data sets and I do not see an efficient way to apply it to larger data sets where this reduction could be significant.	weakness
2020-1114	Hence, I will recommend the rejection of this paper.	decision
2020-1114	To merit acceptance to *CONF* the authors need to provide a cleaner presentation (especially of the algorithms), with a focus on the incremental improvements over BOT, an empirical analysis on larger datasets, and a detailed look into the computational aspects of the proposed approach.	suggestion

2020-1116	This paper investigated the effect of network width on learned features using activation atlases.	abstract

2020-1135	This paper proposes a new model, the Routing Transformer, which endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention from O(n^2) to O(n^1.5).	abstract
2020-1135	The model attained very good performance on WikiText-103 (in terms of perplexity) and similar performance to baselines (published numbers) in two other tasks. <sep>	abstract
2020-1135	Even though the problem addressed (reducing the quadratic complexity of self-attention) is extremely relevant and the proposed approach is very intuitive and interesting, the reviewers raised some concerns, notably: <sep> - How efficient is the proposed approach in practice.	weakness
2020-1135	Even though the theoretical complexity is reduced, more modules were introduced (eg, forced clustering, mix of local heads and clustering heads, sorting, etc.) <sep>	weakness
2020-1135	- Why is W_R fixed random?	weakness
2020-1135	Since W_R is orthogonal, it's just a random (generalized) "rotation" (performed on the word embedding space).	weakness
2020-1135	Does this really provide sensible "routing"? <sep>	weakness
2020-1135	- The experimental section can be improved to better understand the impact of the proposed method.	weakness
2020-1135	Adding ablations, as suggested by the reviewers, would be an important part of this work. <sep>	weakness
2020-1135	- Not clear why the work needs to be motivated through NMF, since the proposed method uses k-means. <sep>	weakness
2020-1135	Unfortunately several points raised by the reviewers (except R2) were not addressed in the author rebuttal, and therefore it is not clear if some of the raised issues are fixable in camera ready time, which prevents me from recommend this paper to be accepted. <sep>	decision
2020-1135	However, I *do* think the proposed approach is very interesting and has great potential, once these points are clarified.	strength
2020-1135	The gains obtained in WikiText-103 are promising.	strength
2020-1135	Therefore, I strongly encourage the authors to resubmit this paper taking into account the suggestions made by the reviewers.	decision

2020-1143	This paper proposes a GA-based method for optimizing the loss function a model is trained on to produce better models (in terms of final performance).	abstract
2020-1143	The general consensus from the reviewers is that the paper, while interesting, dedicates too much of its content to analyzing one such discovered loss (the Baikal loss), and that the experimental setting (MNIST and Cifar10) is too basic to be conclusive.	weakness
2020-1143	It seems this paper can be so significantly improved with some further and larger scale experiments that it would be wrong to prematurely recommend acceptance.	decision
2020-1143	My recommendation is that the authors consider the reviewer feedback, run the suggested further experiments, and are hopefully in the position to submit a significantly stronger version of this paper to a future conference.	decision

2020-1160	This paper is an empirical studies of methods to stabilize offline (ie, batch) RL methods where the dataset is available up front and not collected during learning.	abstract
2020-1160	This can be an important setting in eg safety critical or production systems, where learned policies should not be applied on the real system until their performance and safety is verified.	abstract
2020-1160	Since policies leave the area where training data is present, in such settings poor performance or divergence might result, unless divergence from the reference policy is regularized.	abstract
2020-1160	This paper studies various methods to perform such regularization. <sep>	abstract
2020-1160	The reviewers are all very happy about the thoroughness of the empirical work.	strength
2020-1160	The work only studies existing methods (and combination thereof), so the novelty is limited by design.	weakness
2020-1160	The paper was also considered well written and easy to follow.	strength
2020-1160	The results were very similar between the considered regularizers, which somehow limits the usefulness of the paper as practical guideline (although at least now we know that perhaps we do not need to spend a lot of time choosing the best between these).	weakness
2020-1160	Bigger differences were observed between "value penalties" versus "policy regularization".	weakness
2020-1160	This seems to correspond to theoretical observations by Neu et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07798, 2017), which is not cited in the manuscript.	weakness
2020-1160	Although unpublished, I think that work is highly relevant for the current manuscript, and I'd strongly recommend the authors to consider its content.	suggestion
2020-1160	Some minor comments about the paper are given below. <sep>	misc
2020-1160	On the balance, the strong point of the paper is the empirical thoroughness and clarity, whereas novelty, significance, and theoretical analysis are weaker points.	weakness
2020-1160	Due to the high selectivity of *CONF*, I unfortunately have to recommend rejection for this manuscript. <sep>	decision
2020-1160	I have some minor comments about the contents of the paper: <sep> - The manuscript contains the line:  "Under this definition, such a behavior policy πb is always well-defined even if the dataset was collected by multiple, distinct behavior policies".	weakness
2020-1160	Wouldn't simply defining the behavior as a mixture of the underlying behavior policies (when known) work equally well? <sep>	weakness
2020-1160	- The paper mentions several earlier works that regularize policies update using the KL from a reference policy (or to a reference policy).	weakness
2020-1160	The paper of Peters is cited in this context, although there the constraint is actually on the KL divergence between state-action distributions, resulting in a different type of regularization.	weakness

2020-1162	This work proposes a dynamical systems model to allow the user to better control sequence generation via the latent z. Reviewers all agreed the that the proposed method is quite interesting.	strength
2020-1162	However, reviewers also felt that current evaluations were weak and were ultimately unconvinced by the author rebuttal.	rebuttal_process
2020-1162	I recommend the authors resubmit with a stronger set of experiments as suggested by Reviewers 2 and 3.	decision

2020-1164	The authors observe that batch normalization using the statistics computed from a *test* batch significantly improves out-of-distribution detection with generative models.	abstract
2020-1164	Essentially, normalizing an OOD test batch using the test batch statistics decreases the likelihood of that batch and thus improves detection of OOD examples.	abstract
2020-1164	The reviewers seemed concerned with this setting and they felt that it gives a significant advantage over existing methods since they typically deal with single test example.	weakness
2020-1164	The reviewers thus wanted empirical comparisons to methods designed for this setting, ie traditional statistical tests for comparing distributions.	suggestion
2020-1164	Despite some positive discussion, this paper unfortunately falls below the bar for acceptance.	decision
2020-1164	The authors added significant experiments and hopefully adding these and additional analysis providing some insight into how the batchnorm is helping would make for a stronger submission to a future conference.	decision

2020-1172	The authors propose an invertible flow-based model for molecular graph generation.	abstract

2020-1173	The paper proposes a tensor-based extension to graph convolutional networks for prediction over dynamic graphs. <sep>	abstract
2020-1173	The proposed model is reasonable and achieves promising empirical results.	strength
2020-1173	After discussion, it is agreed that while the problem of handling dynamic graphs is interesting and challenging, the proposed tensor method lacks novelty, the theoretical analysis is artificial, and the empirical study does not cover enough benchmarks. <sep>	weakness
2020-1173	The current version of the paper is not ready for publication.	decision
2020-1173	Addressing the issues above could lead to a strong publication in the future.	suggestion

2020-1178	This paper proposes a new dimensionality reduction technique that tries to preserve the global structure of the data as measured by the relative distances between triplets.	abstract
2020-1178	As Reviewer 1 noted, the construction of the TriMap algorithm is fairly heuristic, making it difficult to determine how TriMap ought to behave "better" than existing dimensionality reduction approaches other than through qualitative assessment.	weakness
2020-1178	Here, I share Reviewer 2's concern that the qualitative behavior of TriMap is difficult to distinguish from existing methods in many of the figures.	weakness

2020-1179	The authors propose a notion of feature robustness, provide a straightforward decomposition of risk in terms of this robustness measure, and then provide some empirical evidence for their perspective.	abstract

2020-1179	eg, in the rebuttal the authors say that PAC-Bayes is limited to 0-1 error.	weakness
2020-1179	It is generally trivial to obtain bounds for bounded loss.	weakness
2020-1179	For unbounded loss functions, there are bounds based on, eg, sub gaussian assumptions. <sep>	weakness

2020-1419	The proposed method works well for static background achieving strong pose prediction results.	strength
2020-1419	The weaknesses of the paper are that (1) the proposed method is a fairly reasonable but incremental extension of existing techniques; (2) it relies on a strong assumption on the property of static backgrounds; (3) video prediction results are of limited significance and scope.	weakness
2020-1419	In particular, the proposed method may work for simple data like KTH but is very limited for modeling videos as it is not well-suited to handle moving backgrounds, interactions between objects (eg, robot arm in the foreground and objects in the background), and stochasticity.	weakness

2020-1477	Some issues remain unresolved, though: While the UniLM comparison is currently not apples-to-apples, for example, nothing prevents the authors from using their method to pretrain UniLM.	rebuttal_process
2020-1477	Currently, QA results are low-ish, and it is hard to accept a paper based solely on BLEU scores (questionable metric) for question generation (the task is but a means to an end).	rebuttal_process
2020-1477	Moreover, the authors do not really discuss how their method relates to previous work (see Review 2 and the related work cited there; there's more, eg, [0]).	rebuttal_process
2020-1477	I also find it a little problematic that the paper completely ignores all work prior to 2017: The NLP community started organizing workshops on question generation in 2010. [1]	rebuttal_process

2020-1480	The authors propose an agent that can act in an RL environment to verify hypotheses about it, using hypotheses formulated as triplets of pre-condition, action sequence, and post-condition variables.	abstract
2020-1480	Training then proceeds in multiple stages, including a pretraining phase using a reward function that encourages the agent to learn the hypothesis triplets. <sep>	abstract
2020-1480	Strengths: Reviewers generally agreed it's an important problem and interesting approach <sep>	strength
2020-1480	Weaknesses: There were some points of convergence among reviewer comments: lack of connection to existing literature (ie to causal reasoning and POMDPs), and concerns about the robustness of the results (which were only reporting the max seeds).	weakness
2020-1480	Two reviewers also found the use of natural language to unnecessarily complicate their setup.	weakness
2020-1480	Overall, clarity seemed to be an issue.	weakness
2020-1480	Other comments concerned lack of comparisons, analyses, and suggestions for alternate methods of rewarding the agent (to improve understandability). <sep>	weakness
2020-1480	The authors deserve credit for their responsiveness to reviewer comments and for the considerable amount of additional work done in the rebuttal period.	rebuttal_process
2020-1480	However, these efforts ultimately didn't satisfy the reviewers enough to change their scores.	rebuttal_process
2020-1480	Although I find that the additional experiments and revisions have significantly strengthened the paper, I don't believe it's currently ready for publication at *CONF*.	decision
2020-1480	I urge the authors to focus on clearly presenting and integrating these new results in a future submission, which I look forward to.	suggestion

2020-1491	The paper proposes learning a latent embedding for image manipulation for PixelCNN by using Fisher scores projected to a low-dimensional space. <sep>	abstract
2020-1491	The reviewers have several concerns about this paper: <sep> * Novelty <sep> * Random projection doesn't learn useful representation <sep>	weakness
2020-1491	* Weak evaluations <sep>	weakness
2020-1491	Since two expert reviewers are negative about this paper, I cannot recommend acceptance at this stage.	decision

2020-1522	This paper proposes an approach to handle the problem of unsmoothness while modeling spatio-temporal urban data.	abstract
2020-1522	However all reviewers have pointed major issues with the presentation of the work, and whether the method's complexity is justified.	weakness

2020-1531	This paper proposes an outlier detection method that maps outliers to low probability regions of the latent space.	abstract
2020-1531	The novelty is in proposing a weighted reconstruction error penalizing the mapping of outliers into high probability regions.	abstract
2020-1531	The reviewers find the idea promising. <sep>	strength
2020-1531	They have also raised several questions.	misc
2020-1531	It seems the questions are at least partially addressed in the rebuttal, and as a result one of our expert reviewers (R5) has increased their score from WR to WA.	rebuttal_process
2020-1531	But since we did not have a champion for this paper and its overall score is not high enough, I can only recommend a reject at this stage.	decision

2020-1533	The paper proposes metrics for comparing explainability metrics. <sep>	abstract
2020-1533	Both reviewers and authors have engaged in a thorough discussion of the paper and feedback.	rebuttal_process
2020-1533	The reviewers, although appreciating aspects of the paper, all see major issues with the paper. <sep>	misc
2020-1533	All reviewers recommend reject.	rating_summary

2020-1541	The reviewers generally reached a consensus that the work is not quite ready for acceptance in its current form.	rating_summary
2020-1541	The central concerns were about the potentially limited novelty of the method, and the fact that it was not quite clear how good the annotations needed to be (or how robust the method would be to imperfect annotations).	weakness
2020-1541	This, combined with an evaluation scenario that is non-standard and requires some guesswork to understand its difficulty, leaves one with the impression that it is not quite clear from the experiments whether the method really works well.	weakness
2020-1541	I would recommend for the authors to improve the evaluation in the next submission.	suggestion

2020-1547	The paper proposed the use of a lossy transform coding approach to to reduce the memory bandwidth brought by the storage of intermediate activations.	abstract
2020-1547	It has shown the proposed method can bring good memory usage while maintaining the the accuracy. <sep>	abstract
2020-1547	The main concern on this paper is the limited novelty.	weakness
2020-1547	The lossy transform coding is borrowed from other domains and only the use of it on CNN intermediate activation is new, which seems insufficient.	weakness

2020-1583	The authors extend the framework of randomized smoothing to handle non-Gaussian smoothing distribution and use this to show that they can construct smoothed models that perform well against l2 and linf adversarial attacks.	abstract
2020-1583	They show that the resulting framework can obtain state-of-the-art certified robustness results improving upon prior work. <sep>	abstract
2020-1583	While the paper contains several interesting ideas, the reviewers were concerned about several technical flaws and omissions from the paper: <sep> 1) A theorem on strong duality was incorrect in the initial version of the paper, though this was fixed in the rebuttal.	weakness
2020-1583	However, the reasoning of the authors on the "fundamental trade-off" is specific to the particular framework they consider, and is not really a fundamental trade-off. <sep>	weakness
2020-1583	2) The justification for the new family of distributions constructed by the author is not very clear and the experiments only show marginal improvements over prior work.	weakness
2020-1583	Thus, the significance of this contribution is not clear. <sep>	weakness
2020-1583	Some of the issues were clarified during the rebuttal, but the reviewers remained unconvinced about the above points. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2020-1583	Thus, the paper cannot be accepted in its current form.	decision

2020-1587	This manuscript investigates and characterizes the tradeoff between fairness and accuracy in neural network models.	abstract
2020-1587	The primary empirical contribution is to investigate this tradeoff for a variety of datasets. <sep>	abstract
2020-1587	The reviewers and AC agree that the problem studied is timely and interesting.	strength
2020-1587	However, this manuscript also received quite divergent reviews, resulting from differences in opinion about the novelty of the results.	weakness
2020-1587	IN particular, it is not clear that the idea of a fairness/performance tradeoff is a new one.	weakness
2020-1587	In reviews and discussion, the reviewers also noted issues with clarity of the presentation.	weakness
2020-1587	In the opinion of the AC, the manuscript is not appropriate for publication in its current state.	decision

2020-1595	The paper contains interesting ideas for giving simple explanations to a NN; however, the reviewers do not feel the contribution is sufficiently novel to merit acceptance.	rating_summary

2020-1602	The reviewers agree that this is an interesting paper but it required major modifications.	weakness
2020-1602	After rebuttal, thee paper is much improved but unfortunately not above the bar yet.	decision
2020-1602	We encourage the authors to iterate on this work again.	suggestion

2020-1610	This paper proposes a sensor placement strategy based on maximising the information gain.	abstract
2020-1610	Instead of using Gaussian process, the authors apply neural nets as function approximators.	abstract
2020-1610	A limited empirical evaluation is performed to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. <sep>	abstract
2020-1610	The reviewers have raised several major issues, including the lack of novelty, clarity, and missing critical details in the exposition.	weakness
2020-1610	The authors didn't address any of the raised concerns in the rebuttal.	rebuttal_process
2020-1610	I will hence recommend rejection of this paper.	decision

2020-1611	The paper proposes to study what information is encoded in different layers of StyleGAN.	abstract
2020-1611	The authors do so by training classifiers for different layers of latent codes and investigating whether changing the latent code changes the generated output in the expected fashion. <sep>	abstract
2020-1611	The paper received borderline reviews with two weak accepts and one weak reject.	rating_summary
2020-1611	Initially, the reviewers were more negative (with one reject, one weak reject, and one weak accept).	rebuttal_process
2020-1611	After the rebuttal, the authors addressed most of the reviewer questions/concerns. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2020-1611	Overall, the reviewers thought the results were interesting and appreciated the care the authors took in their investigations.	strength
2020-1611	The main concern of the reviewers is that the analysis is limited to only StyleGAN.	weakness
2020-1611	It would be more interesting and informative if the authors applied their methodology to different GANs.	suggestion
2020-1611	Then they can analyze whether the methodology and findings holds for other types of GANs as well.	suggestion
2020-1611	R1 notes that given the wide interest in StyleGAN-like models, the work maybe of interest to the community despite the limited investigation.	strength
2020-1611	The reviewers also point out the writing can be improved to be more precise. <sep>	weakness
2020-1611	The AC agrees that the paper is mostly well written and well presented.	strength
2020-1611	However, there are limitations in what is achieved in the paper and it would be of limited interest to the community.	weakness
2020-1611	The AC recommends that the authors consider improving their work, potentially broadening their investigation to other GAN architectures, and resubmit to an appropriate venue.	decision

2020-1623	The paper improves the previous method for detecting out-of-distribution  (OOD) samples. <sep>	abstract
2020-1623	Some theoretical analysis/motivation is interesting as pointed out by a reviewer.	strength
2020-1623	I think the paper is well written in overall and has some potential. <sep>	strength
2020-1623	However, as all reviewers pointed out, I think experimental results are quite below the borderline to be accepted (considering the *CONF* audience), ie, the authors should consider non-MNIST-like and more realistic datasets.	decision
2020-1623	This indicates the limitation on the scalability of the proposed method. <sep>	weakness
2020-1623	Hence, I recommend rejection.	decision

2020-1626	Apologies for only receiving two reviews.	misc
2020-1626	R2 gave a WR and R3 gave an A.	rating_summary
2020-1626	Given the lack of 3rd review and split nature of the scores, the AC has closely scrutinized the paper/reviews/comments/rebuttal.	misc
2020-1626	Thoughts: <sep> - Paper is on interesting topic. <sep>	strength
2020-1626	- AC agrees with R2's concern about the evaluation not using more complex environments like Mujoco.	weakness
2020-1626	Without evaluation on a standard benchmark, it is difficult to know objectively if the approach works. <sep>	weakness
2020-1626	- AC agrees with authors that the DISTRAL approach forms a strong baseline. <sep>	strength
2020-1626	- Nevertheless, the experiments aren't super compelling either. <sep>	weakness
2020-1626	- AC has some concerns about scaling issues wrt model size & #tasks. <sep>	weakness
2020-1626	The paper is very borderline, but the AC sides with R2's concerns and unfortunately feels the paper cannot be accepted without a stronger evaluation.	decision

2020-1637	This is an observational work with experiments for comparing iterative pruning methods. <sep>	abstract
2020-1637	I agree with the main concerns of all reviewers: <sep> (a) Experimental setups are of too small-scale or with easy datasets, so hard to believe they would generalize for other settings, eg, large-scale residual networks.	weakness
2020-1637	This aspect is very important as this is an observational paper. <sep>	suggestion
2020-1637	(b) The main take-home contribution/message is weak considering the high-standard of *CONF*. <sep>	weakness

2020-1660	In this work, the authors focus on the high-dimensional regime in which both the dataset size and the number of features tend to infinity.	abstract
2020-1660	They analyze the performance of a simple regression model trained on the random features and revealed several interesting and important observations. <sep>	abstract
2020-1660	Unfortunately, the reviewers could not reach a consensus as to whether this paper had sufficient novelty to merit acceptance at this time.	rating_summary

2020-1688	This paper proposes  architectural modifications to transformers, which are promising for sequential tasks requiring memory but can be unstable to optimize, and applies the resulting method to the RL setting, evaluated in the DMLab-30 benchmark. <sep>	abstract
2020-1688	While I thought the approach was interesting and the results promising, the reviewers unanimously felt that the experimental evaluation could be more thorough, and were concerned with the motivation behind of some of the proposed changes.	weakness

2020-1698	The paper proposed the use of dynamic convolutional kernels as a way to reduce inference computation cost, which is a linear combination of static kernels and fused after training for inference to reduce computation cost.	abstract
2020-1698	The authors evaluated the proposed methods on a variety models and shown good FLOPS reduction while maintaining accuracy. <sep>	abstract
2020-1698	The main concern for this paper is the limited novelty.	weakness
2020-1698	There have been many works use dynamic convolutions as pointed out by all the reviewers.	weakness
2020-1698	The most similar ones are SENet and soft conditional computation.	weakness
2020-1698	Although the authors claim that soft conditional computation "focus on using more parameters to make models to be more expressive while we focus on reducing redundant calculations", the methods are pretty the same and moreover in the abstract of soft conditional computation they have "CondConv improves the performance and inference cost trade-off".	weakness

2020-1720	The authors take inspiration from regulatory fit theory and propose a new parameter for policy gradient algorithms in RL that can manage the "regulatory focus" of an agent.	abstract
2020-1720	They hypothesize that this can affect performance in a problem-specific way, especially when trading off between broad exploration and risk.	abstract
2020-1720	The reviewers expressed concerns about the usefulness of the proposed algorithm in practice and a lack of thorough empirical comparisons or theoretical results.	weakness

2020-1730	The paper addresses the setting of learning with rejection while incorporating the ideas from learning with adversarial examples to tackle adversarial attacks.	abstract
2020-1730	While the reviewers acknowledged the importance to study learning with rejection in this setting, they raised several concerns: (1) lack of technical contribution -- see R1's and R2's related references, see R3's suggestion on designing c(x); (2) insufficient empirical evidence -- see R3's comment about the sensitivity experiment on the strength of the attack, see R1's suggestion to compare with a baseline that learns the rejection function such as SelectiveNet;  (3) clarity of presentation -- see R2's suggestions how to improve clarity. <sep>	weakness
2020-1730	Among these, (3) did not have a substantial impact on the decision, but would be helpful to address in a subsequent revision.	misc
2020-1730	However, (1) and (2) make it very difficult to assess the benefits of the proposed approach, and were viewed by AC as critical issues. <sep>	weakness

2020-1772	This paper proposes to represent the distribution wrt which neural architecture search (NAS) samples architectures through a variational autoencoder, rather than through a fully factorized distribution (as previous work did). <sep>	abstract
2020-1772	In the discussion, a few things improved (causing one reviewer to increase his/her score from 1 to 3), but it became clear that the empirical evaluation has issues, with a different search space being used for the method than for the baselines.	rebuttal_process

2020-1772	I agree with this judgement and thus recommend rejection.	decision

2020-1775	This paper addresses the problem of exploration in challenging RL environments using self-imitation learning.	abstract
2020-1775	The idea behind the proposed approach is for the agent to imitate a diverse set of its own past trajectories.	abstract
2020-1775	To achieve this, the authors introduce a policy conditioned on trajectories.	abstract
2020-1775	The proposed approach is evaluated on various domains including Atari Montezuma's Revenge and MuJoCo. <sep>	abstract
2020-1775	Given that the evaluation is purely empirical, the major concern is in the design of experiments.	weakness
2020-1775	The amount of stochasticity induced by the random initial state alone does not lead to convincing results regarding the performance of the proposed approach compared with baselines (eg Go-Explore).	weakness
2020-1775	With such simple stochasticity, it is not clear why one could not use a model to recover from it and then rely on an existing technique like Go-Explore.	weakness
2020-1775	Although this paper tackles an important problem (hard-exploration RL tasks), all reviewers agreed that this limitation is crucial and I therefore recommend to reject this paper.	decision

2020-1782	The authors show that in a reinforcement learning setting, partial models can be causally incorrect, leading to improper evaluation of policies that are different from those used to collect the data for the model.	abstract
2020-1782	They then propose a backdoor correction to this problem that allows the model to generalize properly by separating the effects of the stochasticity of the environment and the policy.	abstract
2020-1782	The reviewers had substantial concerns about both issues of clarity and the clear, but largely undiscussed, connection to off-policy policy evaluation (OPPE). <sep>	weakness
2020-1782	In response, the authors made a significant number of changes for the sake of clarity, as well as further explained the differences between their approach and the OPPE setting.	rebuttal_process
2020-1782	First, OPPE is not typically model-based.	rebuttal_process
2020-1782	Second, while an importance sampling solution would be technically possible, by re-training the model based on importance-weighted experiences, this would need to be done for every evaluation policy considered, whereas the authors' solution uses a fundamentally different approach of causal reasoning so that a causally correct model can be learned once and work for all policies. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2020-1782	After much discussion, the reviewers could not come to a consensus about the validity of these arguments.	rebuttal_process
2020-1782	Futhermore, there were lingering questions about writing clarity.	rebuttal_process
2020-1782	Thus, in the future, it appears the paper could be significantly improved if the authors cite more of the off policy evaluation literature, in addition to their added textual clairifications of the relation of their work to that body of work.	suggestion
2020-1782	Overall, my recommendation at this time is to reject this paper.	decision

2020-1804	This manuscript describes a continual learning approach where individual instances consist of sequences, such as language modeling.	abstract
2020-1804	The paper consists of a definition of a problem setting, tasks in that problem setting, baselines (not based on existing continual learning approaches, which the authors argue is to highlight the need for such techniques, but with which the reviewers took issue), and a novel architecture. <sep>	abstract
2020-1804	Reviews focused on the gravity of the contribution.	misc
2020-1804	R1 and R2, in particular, argued that the paper is written as though the problem/benchmark definition is the main contribution.	weakness
2020-1804	R2 mentions that in spite of this, the methods section jumps directly into the candidate architecture.	weakness
2020-1804	As mentioned above, several reviewers also took issue with the fact that existing CL techniques are not employed as baselines.	weakness
2020-1804	The authors engaged with reviewers and promised updates, but did not take the opportunity to update their paper. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2020-1804	As many of the reviewers' comments remain unaddressed and the authors' updates did not materialize, I recommend rejection, and encourage the authors to incorporate the feedback they have received in a future submission.	decision

2020-1810	This paper proposes a new black-box adversarial attack based on tiling and evolution strategies.	abstract
2020-1810	While the experimental results look promising, the main concern of the reviewers is the novelty of the proposed algorithm, and many things need to be improved in terms of clarity and experiments.	weakness
2020-1810	The paper does not gather sufficient support from the reviewers even after author response.	rebuttal_process
2020-1810	I encourage the authors to improve this paper and resubmit to future conference.	decision

2020-1813	The author propose a method called global momentum compression for sparse communication setting, and provided some theoretical results on the convergence rate.	abstract
2020-1813	The convergence result is interesting, but the underlying assumptions used in the analysis appear very strong.	weakness
2020-1813	Moreover, the proposed algorithm has limited novelty as it is only a minor modification.	weakness
2020-1813	Another main concern is that the proposed algorithm shows little performance improvement in the experiments.	weakness
2020-1813	Moreover, more related algorithms should be included in the experimental comparison.	weakness

2020-1819	The reviewers were quite split on the paper. <sep>	misc
2020-1819	On the one hand, there was a general excitement about the direction of the paper.	strength
2020-1819	The idea of speeding up gradient descent is of course hugely relevant to the current machine learning landscape.	strength
2020-1819	The approach was also considered novel, and the paper well-written. <sep>	strength
2020-1819	However, the reviewers also pointed out multiple shortcomings.	misc
2020-1819	The experimental section was deemed to lack clarity and baselines.	weakness
2020-1819	The results on standard dataset were very different from expected, causing worry about the reliability, although this has partially been addressed in additional experiments.	weakness
2020-1819	The applicability to deep learning and large dataset, as well as the significance of time saved by using this method, were other worries. <sep>	weakness
2020-1819	Unfortunately, I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers that the idea is fascinating, but that more work is required for acceptance to *CONF*.	decision

2020-1823	The paper proposes a generative model that jointly trains an implicit generative model and an explicit energy based model using Stein's method.	abstract

2020-1831	The paper analyses the effect of different loss functions for TransE and argues that certain limitations of TransE can be mitigated by choosing more appropriate loss functions.	abstract
2020-1831	The submission then proposes TransComplEx to further improve results.	abstract
2020-1831	This paper received four reviews, with three recommending rejection, and one recommending weak acceptance.	rating_summary
2020-1831	A main concern was in the clarity of motivating the different models.	weakness
2020-1831	Another was in the relatively low performance of RotatE compared with [1], which was raised by multiple reviewers.	weakness

2020-1837	This paper proposes a curriculum-based reinforcement learning approach to improve theorem proving towards longer proofs.	abstract
2020-1837	While the authors are tackling an important problem, and their method appears to work on the environment it was tested in, the reviewers found the experimental section too narrow and not convincing enough.	weakness
2020-1837	In particular, the authors are encouraged to apply their methods to more complex domains beyond Robinson arithmetic.	suggestion
2020-1837	It would also be helpful to get a more in depth analysis of the role of the curriculum.	suggestion
2020-1837	The discussion period did not lead to improvements in the reviewers' scores, hence I recommend that this paper is rejected at this time.	decision

2020-1860	- I wish the image dataset experiments had been done with larger images and models. <sep>	weakness
2020-1860	Ultimately, the straightforwardness of the extension and the relative niche applications mean that although the main idea is sound, the quality and the overall impact of this paper don't quite meet the bar.	decision

2020-1872	The main concern raised by the reviewers is that the paper is difficult to read and potentially unclear.	weakness
2020-1872	Therefore, the area chair read the paper, and also found it fairly dense and challenging to read.	weakness
2020-1872	While there may be important discoveries in the paper, the paper in its current form makes it too difficult to read.	weakness
2020-1872	Since four reviewers (including the AC) struggled to understand the paper, we believe the presentation of the paper should be improved.	weakness

2020-1920	This work tackles the problem of catastrophic forgetting by using Gaussian processes to identify "memory samples" to regularize learning. <sep>	abstract
2020-1920	Although the approach seems promising and well-motivated, the reviewers ultimately felt that some claims, such as scalability, need stronger justifications.	weakness
2020-1920	These justifications could come, for example, from further experiments, including ablation studies to gain insights.	suggestion
2020-1920	Making the paper more convincing in this way is particularly desirable since the directions taken by this paper largely overlap with recent literature (as argued by reviewers).	weakness

2020-1988	It provides the empirical demonstration that the proposed approach is competitive to existing pooling approaches.	abstract
2020-1988	However, although the paper shows an interesting observation, there are remaining novelty as well as clarity concerns.	weakness
2020-1988	In particular, the contribution of the proposed work over the graph kernels based on other forms of coarsening such as the early work of Shervashidze et al as well as higher-order WL (pointed out by Reviewer1) remains unclear.	weakness

2020-1999	This paper tackles the interesting problem of meta-learning in problem spaces where training "tasks" are scarce.	abstract
2020-1999	Two criticisms that seems to shared across reviewers are that (i) it is debatable how "novel" the space of meta learning with "few" tasks is, especially since there aren't established standard for how many training tasks should be available, and (ii) the paper could use more comparisons with baseline methods and ablations to understand the contributions.	weakness
2020-1999	As an AC, I down-weight criticism (i) because I don't feel the paper has to be creating a new problem definition; it's acceptable to make advances within an existing space.	ac_disagreement
2020-1999	However, criticism (ii) seems to remain.	misc
2020-1999	After conferring with reviewers it seems that the rebuttal was not strong enough to significantly alter the reviewer's opinions on this issue, and so the paper does not have enough support to justify acceptance.	decision
2020-1999	The paper certainly addresses interesting issues, and I look forward to seeing a revised/improved version at another venue.	decision

2020-2000	This work introduces a simple and effective method for ensemble distillation.	abstract
2020-2000	The method is a simple extension of earlier "prior networks": it differs in which, instead of fitting a single network to mimic a distribution produced by the ensemble, this work suggests to use multi-head (one head per individual ensemble member) in order to better capture the ensemble diversity.	abstract
2020-2000	This paper experimentally shows that multi-head architecture performs well on MNIST and CIFAR-10 (they added CIFAR-100 in the revised version) in terms of accuracy and uncertainty. <sep>	abstract
2020-2000	While the method is effective and the experiments on CIFAR-100 (a harder task) improved the paper, the reviewers (myself included) pointed out in the discussion phase that the limited novelty remains a major weakness.	rebuttal_process
2020-2000	The proposed method seems like a trivial extension of the prior work, and does not provide much additional insight.	rebuttal_process
2020-2000	To remedy this shortcoming, I suggest the authors provide extensive experimental supports including various datasets and ablation studies. <sep>	suggestion
2020-2000	Another concern mentioned in the discussion is the fact that these small improvements are in spite of the fact that the proposed method ends up using many more parameters than the baselines.	weakness
2020-2000	Including and comparing different model sizes in a full fledged experimental evaluation would better convey the trade-offs of the proposed approach.	suggestion

2020-2003	The authors build upon the idea from [Zheng,2019], namely finding gradient updates in the space perpendicular to the input vectors of the previous tasks resulting in less forgetting, and propose an improvement, namely to use principal component analysis to enable learning new tasks without restricting their solution space as in [Zheng,2019]. <sep>	abstract
2020-2003	While the reviewers acknowledge the importance to study continual learning, they raised several concerns that were viewed by the AC as critical issues: (1) convincing experimental evaluation -- an analysis that clearly shows how and when the proposed method can solve the issue that [Zheng,2019] faces with (task similarity/dissimilarity scenario) would substantially strengthen the evaluation and would allow to assess the scope and contributions of this work; also see R3's detailed concerns and questions on empirical evaluation, R2's suggestion to follow the standard protocols, and R1's suggestion to use PackNet and HAT as baselines for comparison;  (2) lack of presentation clarity -- see R2's concerns how to improve, and R1's suggestions on how to better position the paper. <sep>	weakness
2020-2003	A general consensus among reviewers and AC suggests, in its current state the manuscript is not ready for a publication.	decision

2020-2114	The paper does a series of empirical studies on this topic.	abstract
2020-2114	Among other things the authors observe that larger models can increase the number latent variables recovered when fitting larger variational inference models.	abstract
2020-2114	The reviewers raised some concern about the simplicity of the models studied and also lack of some theoretical justification.	weakness
2020-2114	One reviewer also suggests that more experiments and ablation studies on more general models will further help clarify the role over-parameterized model for latent generative models.	suggestion
2020-2114	I agree with the reviewers that this paper is "compelling reason for theoretical research on the interplay between overparameterization and parameter recovery in latent variable neural networks trained with gradient descent methods".	strength
2020-2114	I disagree with the reviewers that theoretical study is required as I think a good empirical paper with clear conjectures is as important.	ac_disagreement
2020-2114	I do agree with the reviewers however that for empirical paper I think the empirical studies would have to be a bit more thorough with more clear conjectures.	weakness
2020-2114	In summary, I think the paper is nice and raises a lot of interesting questions but can be improved with more through studies and conjectures.	weakness

2020-2121	This manuscript investigates the posterior collapse in variational autoencoders and seeks to provide some explanations from the phenomenon.	abstract
2020-2121	The primary contribution is to propose some previously understudied explanations for the posterior collapse that results from the optimization landscape of the log-likelihood portion of the ELBO. <sep>	abstract
2020-2121	The reviewers and AC agree that the problem studied is timely and interesting, and closely related to a variety of recent work investigating the landscape properties of variational autoencoders and other generative models.	strength
2020-2121	However, this manuscript also received quite divergent reviews, resulting from differences in opinion about the technical difficulty and importance of the results.	misc

2020-2125	The submission is a detailed and extensive examination of overfitting in vision-and-language navigation domains.	abstract
2020-2125	The authors evaluate several methods across multiple environments, using different splits of the environment data into training, validation-seen, and validation-unseen.	abstract
2020-2125	The authors also present an approach using semantic features which is shown to have little or no gap between training and validation performance. <sep>	abstract
2020-2125	The reviewers had mixed reviews and there was substantial discussion about the merits of the paper.	misc
2020-2125	However, a significant issue was observed and confirmed with the authors, relating to tuning the semantic features and agent model on the unseen validation data.	weakness
2020-2125	This is an important flaw, since the other methods were not tuned in this way, and there was no 'test' performance given in the paper.	weakness

2020-2148	The reviewers initially gave scores of 1,1,3 citing primarily weak empirical results and a lack of theoretical justification.	rating_summary
2020-2148	The experiments are presented on synthetic examples, which is a great start but the reviewers found that this doesn't give strong enough evidence that the methods developed in the paper would work well in practice.	weakness
2020-2148	The authors did not submit an author response to the reviewers and as such the scores did not change during discussion.	rebuttal_process

2020-2149	Reviewers had concerns about the part played by each piece, the lack of comparison to recent related work, and asked for better explanation of the rationale of the method and more experimental details.	rebuttal_process
2020-2149	Authors provided explanations and details, and a more thorough set of comparison to other work, showing better performance in some but not all cases. <sep>	rebuttal_process

2020-2152	The authors propose a model-based RL algorithm, consisting of learning a deterministic multi-step reward prediction model and a vanilla CEM-based MPC actor. <sep>	abstract
2020-2152	In contrast to prior work, the model does not attempt to learn from observations nor is a value function learned. <sep>	abstract

2020-2152	Furthermore, I think the approach is fundamentally limited: All the learning derives from the immediate, dense reward signal, whereas the main challenges in RL are found in sparse reward settings that require planning over long horizons, where value functions or similar methods to assign credit over long time windows are absolutely essential.	weakness

2020-2153	This paper pursues an ambitious goal to provide a theoretical analysis HRL in terms of regret bounds.	abstract
2020-2153	However, the exposition of the ideas has severe clarity issues and the assumptions about HMDPs used are overly simplistic to have an impact in RL research. <sep>	weakness

2020-2161	This paper presents a method for providing uncertainty for deep learning regressors through assigning a notion of evidence to the predictions.	abstract
2020-2161	This is done by putting priors on the parameters of the Gaussian outputs of the model and estimating these via an empirical Bayes-like optimization.	abstract
2020-2161	The reviewers in general found the methodology sensible although incremental in light of Sensoy et al and Malinin & Gales but found the experiments thorough.	strength
2020-2161	A comment on the paper pointed out that the approach was very similar to something presented in the thesis of Malinin (it seems unfair to expect the authors to have been aware of this, but the thesis should be cited and not just the paper which is a different contribution).	weakness
2020-2161	In discussion, one reviewer raised their score from weak reject to weak accept but the highest scoring reviewer explicitly was not willing to champion the paper and raise their score to accept.	rebuttal_process
2020-2161	Thus the recommendation here is to reject.	decision
2020-2161	Taking the reviewer feedback into account, incorporating the proposed changes and adding more careful treatment of related work would make this a much stronger submission to a future conference.	suggestion

2020-2188	The paper proposes to use the representation learned via CPC to do reward shaping via clustering the embedding and providing a reward based on the distance from the goal. <sep>	abstract
2020-2188	The reviewers point out some conceptual issues with the paper, the key one being that the method is contingent on a random policy being able to reach the goal, which is not true for difficult environments that the paper claims to be motivated by.	weakness
2020-2188	One reviewer noted limited experiment runs and lack of comparisons with other reward shaping methods. <sep>	weakness

2020-2191	The authors made no attempt to argue these points in their rebuttals and so I went looking at the paper to find the answer in their revisions, but did not find it after scanning through the paper.	rebuttal_process
2020-2191	I think a paper like this needs to explain what is gained and what obstructions earlier approaches met, and why the current techniques side step those.	suggestion
2020-2191	One of the reviewers felt that the fixed cardinality assumption was mild.	weakness
2020-2191	I'm really not sure why the authors didn't attack this idea.	rebuttal_process

2020-2191	I think the paper simply needs to make a better case that it is not merely an exercise in topology.	suggestion
2020-2191	I think the result here is publishable on its own grounds, but for the paper to effectively communicate those findings, the authors should have revised it to address these issues.	suggestion
2020-2191	They chose not to and so I recommend *CONF* take a pass.	decision

2021-115	Based on Hara et al's method, the authors propose a novel influence estimation for GANs, and an evaluation scheme based on popular GAN evaluation methods, exploiting the fact that they are differentiable with respect to their input data.	abstract
2021-115	The paper demonstrates empirically that the proposed influence estimation method correlates to true influence.	abstract

2021-115	They also requested that the authors add a metric that trades fidelity and diversity like P&R.	rebuttal_process
2021-115	The reviewer originally felt that the paper was below the bar, because it was "like a story without a satisfying conclusion".	rebuttal_process

2021-215	The authors' rebuttal was quite detailed, and appreciated, but left some important questions unanswered.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	The first and critical issue is about the causal nature of the simulator.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	The simulator's name is "causalworld" and its stated goal is to provide "a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment."	rebuttal_process
2021-215	Also, the first bullet in the list of contributions is: "We propose CausalWorld, a new benchmark comprising a parametrized family of robotic manipulation environments for advancing out-of-distribution generalization and causal structure learning in RL."	rebuttal_process
2021-215	After reading the paper, I was quite surprised to realize there is no single example of a causal model, in any shape or form (eg, SCM, DAG, Physics) or a structural learning benchmark.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	In other words, there is a serious, somewhat nontrivial gap between the claimed contributions and what was realized in the paper.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	One way to address this issue would be to make the causality more explicit in the paper, for example, by sharing the underlying structural causal model, how variables form causal relationships, what causal structures are being learned, and how these learned structures compare with the ground truth.	suggestion
2021-215	I think these would be reasonable expectations of a simulator that aims to disentangle the causal aspect of the learning process. <sep>	suggestion
2021-215	The second issue is about the experimental results in terms of generalizability.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	The authors emphasized on different occasions that "The primary goal of this work is to provide the tools to build and evaluate generalizable agents in a more systematic fashion, rather than building generalizable agents for the tasks specified," or "the experiments is to showcase the flexibility regarding curricula and performance evaluation schemes offered with CausalWorld, rather than solving new tasks or proposing new algorithms."	rebuttal_process
2021-215	These responses are somewhat not satisfactory given that the goal of the paper is providing tools to build generalizable agents, while the authors seem to suggest they are not committed to actually building such agents.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	Specifically, the experiments did not demonstrate the simulator as a benchmark but only showcased its flexibility (ie, offering a large number of degrees of freedom).	rebuttal_process
2021-215	One suggestion would be to evaluate how algorithms (agents) with varying degrees of "generalizability" power perform across tasks with various difficulty levels.	suggestion
2021-215	As it currently stands, the tasks are too easy or too hard for the standard, uncategorized algorithms, which makes it difficult to learn any lessons from running something in the simulator. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-215	Lastly, I should mention that the work has a great potential to introduce causal concepts and causal reasoning to robotics, there is a natural and compelling educational component here.	strength
2021-215	Still, the complete absence of any discussion of causality and the current literature results hurt this connection and the realization of this noble goal.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	I believe that after reading the paper, the regular causal inference researcher will not be able to understand what assumptions and types of challenges are entailed by this paper and robotics research.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	On the other hand, the robotics researcher will not be able to understand what a causal model is and the tools currently available in causal reasoning that may be able to help solve the practical challenges of robotics.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	In other words, this is a huge missed opportunity since there is a complementary nature of what the paper is trying to do in robotics and the results available in causal inference.	rebuttal_process
2021-215	I believe readers expect and would benefit from having this connection clearly articulated and realized in a more explicit fashion. <sep>	suggestion
2021-215	If the issues listed above are addressed, I believe the paper can be a game-changer in understanding and investigating robotics & causality.	suggestion
2021-215	Given the aforementioned potential and reasons, I recommend the paper's acceptance under the assumption that the authors will take the constructive feedback provided in this meta-review into account and revise the manuscript accordingly.	decision

2021-220	The paper is proposing a new framework for understanding generalization in the deep learning.	abstract
2021-220	The main idea is considering the difference of stochastic optimization on a population risk and optimization on an empirical risk.	abstract
2021-220	The classical theory considers the difference of empirical risk and population risk.	abstract
2021-220	This basically translates the practical motivation from finding good function classes to finding good optimizers which can re-use the data effectively.	abstract
2021-220	Although the paper provides no theoretical result, it provides an interesting empirical study.	strength
2021-220	The paper somewhat demonstrates that SGD on deep networks is somehow good at re-using the same data.	strength
2021-220	I believe this angle is very novel and might hope to future theoretical discoveries.	strength
2021-220	The paper is reviewed by four reviewers and two of them argue its acceptance and two of them argue rejection.	rating_summary
2021-220	After discussion, this status remained and I carefully read and reviewed the paper.	misc
2021-220	Here are the major issues raised by the reviewers: <sep> R#1: The paper is missing a theoretical study.	weakness
2021-220	The implications on the practical deep learning is not clear. <sep>	weakness
2021-220	R#2: Choice of the soft-error is particular to the task and how to go beyond soft-max is not clear. <sep>	weakness

2021-220	Moreover, the paper is rather easy to understand and the results are very farm from trivial.	ac_disagreement
2021-220	However, the other issues raised by other reviewers are valid.	misc
2021-220	Specifically, soft-error seems to be a limitation of the study.	weakness
2021-220	However, the authors respond to this concern and reviewer increases their score.	rebuttal_process
2021-220	I believe the theory is lacking but the paper is simply showing this novel approach and its empirical validity.	weakness
2021-220	A theory to explain this phenomenon would be amazing but not necessary for publication.	suggestion
2021-220	Similarly, without a theory it is hard to expect any practical implication.	weakness
2021-220	Overall, I believe the paper is an interesting and novel one which will likely to lead additional work in the area.	strength
2021-220	Considering we are still far from a satisfying theory of generalization for deep learning and the role of the optimization is clear, this angle worth sharing with the community.	strength
2021-220	Hence, I decide to accept.	decision
2021-220	However, I have some concerns which should be addressed by the camera-ready.<sep>	misc
2021-220	Claims should be revised and authors should make sure they have enough evidence for them.	suggestion
2021-220	For example, authors provide no satisfying evidence for random labels or very limited evidence for pre-training.	suggestion
2021-220	I strongly recommend authors to either remove some of these discussions or present in a fashion which is not a result but part of the discussion for future research. <sep>	suggestion
2021-220	A section about limitations should be added.	suggestion
2021-220	Specifically, the soft-error choice should be discussed in this limitation section. <sep>	suggestion
2021-220	Discussion section should be extended with the pointers to the relevant work on bootstrap literature as well as suggestions to the theoreticians.	suggestion

2021-270	Compared to these, the manuscript exhibits a number of strong contributions: It presents a theoretical analysis of the conversion error and consequently arrives at a principled way to reduce the conversion error.	abstract
2021-270	The authors test the performance of the conversion on a number of challenging data sets.	abstract
2021-270	Their method achieves excellent performances with reduced simulation time / latency (usually, in order to achieve comparable performance to ANNs, one needs to run the SNN for many simulated time steps- this simulation time is reduced by their model). <sep>	abstract
2021-270	One reviewer criticized that the article was hard to read, but this opinion was not shared by other reviewers and the authors have improved the readability in a revision. <sep>	rebuttal_process

2021-338	This paper considers a new setting of robustness, where multiple predictions are simultaneously made based on a single input.	abstract
2021-338	Different from existing robustness certificates which independently consider perturbation of each prediction, the authors propose collective robustness certificate that computes the number of predictions which are simultaneously guaranteed to remain stable under perturbation.	abstract

2021-339	This paper studies the link between generalization behavior and "flatness" of the loss landscape in deep networks.	abstract
2021-339	Specifically, the authors study two measures of flatness (local entropy and local energy), and show that these two measurements are strongly correlated with one another.	abstract
2021-339	Moreover they show via a careful set of numerical experiments that two previously proposed algorithms (entropy SGD and replica SGD) that optimize for local entropy tend to both find flatter minima as well as provide better generalization. <sep>	abstract
2021-339	Despite the fact that the paper proposes no new models or algorithms, the experiments are compelling and provide non-trivial insights into predicting generalization behavior of deep networks, as well as solid evidence on the benefits of entropy regularization in SGD.	strength

2021-440	This paper presents an empirical study focusing on Bayesian inference on NNGP - a Gaussian process where the kernel is defined by taking the width of a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to the infinity limit.	abstract
2021-440	The baselines include a finite width BNN with the same architecture, and a proposed GP-BNN hybrid (NNGP-LL) which is similar to GPDNN and deep kernel learning except that the last-layer GP has its kernel defined by the width-limit kernel.	abstract
2021-440	Experiments are performed on both regression and classification tasks, with a focus on OOD data.	abstract

2021-468	I agree with the reviewers that the updated experiments are convincing in terms of the provided comparisons.	rebuttal_process
2021-468	However, the reservations I have about the work can perhaps best be stated as follows: There is quite a bit of work in the area of imitation from observations, which makes a range of different assumptions and utilizes a variety of different domain adaptation techniques.	weakness
2021-468	Much of this work is in the robotics domain (which is cited in the paper), and much of it demonstrates results in fairly realistic settings, often with real humans and real robots.	weakness
2021-468	In comparison, the experiments in this paper are quite simplistic, using toy domains and "demonstrations" obtained from a computational oracle (ie, another policy).	weakness
2021-468	Given the maturity of this field and the current state of the art, I am skeptical of this evaluation, and I think TPIL is a very weak baseline.	weakness
2021-468	That said, I would  defer to the reviewers in this case -- I do think the particular technical contributions that the paper makes are a valuable addition to the literature, though somewhat incremental.	strength
2021-468	I am also sympathetic to the authors in that much of the more successful prior work in this area that does evaluate under realistic conditions makes subtly different assumptions, or utilizes different techniques for which it is difficult to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. <sep>	misc
2021-468	One thing I would request of the authors for the camera ready though is: Please tone down the claims.	suggestion
2021-468	"Human-like 7 DOF Striker" is not human-like, it's a crudely simulated robotic arm that was recolored.	suggestion
2021-468	It would of course be better to have a realistic evaluation (as many prior papers in this field indeed have), but in the absence of that, it is best not to overclaim and be upfront that the evaluation is on relatively simple simulated tasks under conditions that are not necessarily realistic (and have nothing to do with actual humans), but meant rather to evaluate in an apples-to-apples manner the particular algorithmic innovations in the method.	suggestion

2021-539	This paper proposes an approach to data augmentation to train image recognition models called SaliencyMix, which involves pasting salient regions (as judged by some saliency detector) of one image into another, and mixing the two labels accordingly.	abstract
2021-539	Most reviewers generally agreed that the proposed approach is simple -- it is easy to understand the method and its motivation, especially in the context of related augmentation approaches like CutMix -- and has solid experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. <sep>	strength
2021-539	The main objection the more negative reviewers had to the work is a perceived lack of novelty.	weakness
2021-539	In my view it is a new method (even if similar to prior work like CutMix), and as AR5 argues: "this approach probably starts to get to the heart of why these previous strategies work: they are probably less effective ways of doing what this paper suggests."	ac_disagreement
2021-539	The improvements in Table 1, columns 1 & 3 (CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100) especially speak to this -- these improvements with traditional augmentation disabled are quite substantial, even though the differences become marginal when moving to the "+" augmented versions of the dataset (as well as in ImageNet).	ac_disagreement
2021-539	So although the method is indeed similar to CutMix, I agree that it offers valuable insight into why these previous methods work.	ac_disagreement
2021-539	Besides which the results do show improvements over similar methods, even if the improvements are marginal. <sep>	ac_disagreement

2021-573	This paper analyses the signal propagation through residual architectures; then suggests a scaling method which, together with weight standardization, allows to train such networks to high accuracy with batch-norm; it demonstrates that the method performs better than previous methods (Fixup, SkipInit), and can be used on more advanced architectures. <sep>	abstract
2021-573	The reviewers initially had several concerns, but after the author's revision, these concerns were addressed and most reviewers recommended acceptance.	rebuttal_process
2021-573	One reviewer did not respond, but I think these concerns were addressed.	rebuttal_process
2021-573	I think it will help to further convince the readers on the usefulness of the method readers if the authors would check the sensitivity to the learning rate with the current method and compare with other methods (SkipInit, Fixup, BN).	suggestion
2021-573	The reason I'm suggesting this is that I think one of the main reasons BN is still in popular use is that it commonly tends to make training more robust to changes in hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate (while other methods, like SkipInit and Fixup, require more hyper-parameter tuning). <sep>	suggestion
2021-573	Overall the analysis and the suggested method seem useful, especially at a small batch size and the writing is mostly clear, so I recommend acceptance.	decision

2021-605	The reviewers generally seem to have also appreciated the method, and many of the reviewers' concerns were addressed by the authors during the rebuttal.	rebuttal_process
2021-605	Although the paper does have a number of flaws -- in particular, the evaluation is a bit hard to appreciate, since improvement over prior work is either unclear, or no meaningful comparison is offered, -- I think in this case the benefits outweigh the downsides.	weakness
2021-605	The work is far from perfect, but the ideas that are presented are interested and valuable to the community, and I think that *CONF* attendees will appreciate learning about this work.	decision
2021-605	I would encourage the authors however to improve the paper, and especially the empirical evaluation, as much as possible for the camera-ready, and to take reviewer comments into account insofar as feasible.	suggestion
2021-605	I'm also not sure how much I buy the "overfitting to hyperparameters" argument for unrolled GD, and a less charitable interpretation is that the authors present this issue largely to make up for the comparative lack of other benefits.	suggestion
2021-605	That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think making such a big deal of it is a bit strange.	suggestion
2021-605	It's probably fair to say at this stage that the actual benefits of this approach are a bit modest (though improvements in runtime are a good thing...), but the idea is interesting, and may spur future research.	suggestion

2021-624	This paper provides a clear and useful empirical study of how the initialization scale and activations function affects the generalization capability of neural networks.	abstract
2021-624	Previous works showing the effect of the initialization scale (Chizat and Bach (2018), Geiger et al (2019), Woodorth et al (2020)) had a more limited set of experiments.	abstract
2021-624	Moreover, here an extreme case is shown, wherewith sin activation function no generalization is possible at a large init scale (there the kernel regime is useless for generalization since the hidden layer output becomes very sensitive to any small perturbation in the input).	abstract
2021-624	Lastly, two alignment measures are suggested, which are correlated with the generalization across several architectures and initialization scales. <sep>	abstract
2021-624	All the reviewers argued for acceptance, and one strongly so.	rating_summary
2021-624	I agree that the paper is sufficiently interesting and clear to be accepted.	decision
2021-624	However, despite the high scores, I only recommend a poster and not spotlight/oral: I think the novelty of the empirical study is not groundbreaking, given the experiments in previous works, and the usefulness of the suggested measures are not completely clear without a thorough comparison against previously suggested measures.	decision

2021-632	This paper proposes a method to cope with large vocabulary sizes.	abstract
2021-632	The idea is to find a small number of anchor words and to express every other word as a sparse nonnegative linear combination of them.	abstract
2021-632	They give an end-to-end method for training, and give a statistical interpretation of their algorithm as a Bayesian nonparametric prior (in particular an Indian restaurant process).	abstract
2021-632	They give extensions that allow them to deduce the optimal number of anchors which allows them to avoid needing to tune this hyperparameter.	abstract
2021-632	Finally they give a variety of experiments, particularly in language and recommendation tasks.	abstract
2021-632	The results on language are particularly impressive, and in the author response period, at the behest of a reviewer, they were able to extend the experiments to the Amazon Review dataset which contains 233M reviews on 43.5 M items by 15.2 M users. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-632	This paper is a nice combination of a simple but powerful idea, and a range of experiments demonstrating its utility.	strength
2021-632	Other papers have proposed related ideas, but here the main novelty is in (1) using a small number of anchors that can incorporate domain knowledge and (2) using a sparse linear transformation to express other words in this basis.	strength
2021-632	One reviewer did not find the Bayesian nonparametric interpretation to be fruitful, since it does not lead to techniques for handling growing datasets (eg if the ideal number of anchors changes over time).	weakness

2021-666	The authors proposed a meta learning framework for NAS, namely MetaD2A (Meta Dataset-to-Architecture), that can stochastically generate graphs (architectures) from a given set (dataset) via a dataset-architecture latent space learned with amortized meta-learning.	abstract
2021-666	Each dataset is encoded via a set encoder and the architecutres are obtained via a graph decoder.	abstract
2021-666	MetaD2A is trained once on a database consisting of datasets and pretrained networks and can rapidly search a neural architecture for a novel dataset.	abstract
2021-666	While the set encoder and graph decoder for NAS have been introduced by existing work, the main contribution of the paper is to show that the meta-learning of a "dataset-conditioned architecture generation" framework can enable fast generation of a good architecture without training on the target dataset.	abstract
2021-666	The proposed method is interesting and effective, however it requires an existing pool of good architectures for a given task, which may limit its applicability to a diverse set of real-world problems.	weakness
2021-666	I strongly encourage the authors to include experiments on a larger pool of architectures than the NAS-Bench-201 search space to show the strength of their proposed method in generating good architectures.	suggestion
2021-666	While training MetaD2A with pairs of MetaImageNet and randomly sampled graph shows that the proposed framework can generate graphs with different types of edges, it doesn't show that it can successfully meta-learn to produce better architectures for a new task from an existing pool of good architectures. <sep>	weakness

2021-699	The primary contribution of the paper is the ability to learn disentangled low-dimensional representations that are interpretable from weak supervision using conditional latent variable models. <sep>	abstract
2021-699	The paper was reviewed by three knowledgeable referees, who read the author response and discussed the paper.	misc
2021-699	The paper considers a challenging problem in learning from demonstration, namely dealing with the disparity that exists between the ways in which humans and robots model and observe the world, a problem that is exacerbated when reasoning over high-dimensional multimodal observations.	abstract
2021-699	As the reviewers note, the use of variational inference to learn low-dimensional interpretable representations from weak supervision is compelling.	strength
2021-699	The primary concerns are that the contributions need to be more clearly scoped and that the experimental evaluation is a bit narrow.	weakness
2021-699	The authors make an effort to resolve some of these issues, in part through the inclusion of an additional experiment that considers pouring tasks.	rebuttal_process
2021-699	However, the extent to which this second task mitigates concerns about the narrow evaluation is not fully clear.	rebuttal_process
2021-699	The paper would be strengthened by the inclusion of experiments in a less contrived setting (and one for which the concepts are not necessarily disjoint) as well as a clearer discussion of the primary contributions.	suggestion

2021-713	The major criticism of this paper after the initial reviews was a lack of experimental results on deeper and more modern architectures that include skip connections.	weakness

2021-723	This paper tackles a very important topic in deep RL, namely automatic (non-differentiable) hyper-parameter tuning.	abstract
2021-723	It does so by combining ideas from genetic algorithms and neural architecture search with shared experience replay in order to obtain the key property of sample efficiency.	abstract
2021-723	The proposed solution is communicated clearly, and the results are compelling (often 10x improvements), as well as qualitatively interesting. <sep>	strength
2021-723	Unfortunately for the authors, their original submission contained only part of the intended results, hence the borderline scores by some reviewers.	rating_summary
2021-723	In the meanwhile, a second suite of experiments have been added, which I think are compelling enough evidence to validate the paper's approach.	rebuttal_process

2021-725	This paper takes a step towards understanding the role of nonlinear function approximation--- more specifically, function approximation via (two-layer) neural nets---in some variants of the policy-gradient algorithms.	abstract
2021-725	The authors borrow the mean field analysis idea recently popularized in studying shallow neural nets, and investigate the mean-field limits of the training dynamics in the current RL settings.	abstract
2021-725	The results and analyses are interesting as they nicely complement another line of linearization-based analyses (ie, the one based on neural tangent kernels) towards understanding non-linear function approximation.	strength
2021-725	As suggested by a reviewer, it would be nice to add discussions in the revised paper regarding when the dynamics can be guaranteed to converge to a stationary point.	suggestion

2021-727	This paper proposes a simple generalization to epsilon-greedy exploration that induces temporally extended probes and can leverage options.	abstract
2021-727	The idea and analysis are trivial.	weakness
2021-727	Computational results demonstrate when this sort of exploration is helpful.	abstract

2021-739	This paper proposes to use high dimensional representation for labels to strengthen the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks.	abstract
2021-739	Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improve adversarial robustness.	abstract
2021-739	All reviewer agree that the authors propose an interesting idea and this direction deserves further exploration.	strength
2021-739	On the other hand, the reviewers also raise a serious question: There is a lack of explanation of why high dimensional representation of labels improve adversarial robustness.	weakness
2021-739	Therefore, it is not clear if the proposed method can defend refined attacks tailored to such dimensional label representation.	weakness

2021-742	The paper describes a cool application of online learning from bandit feedback -- creating personalized, adaptive typing interfaces for users with sensorimotor impairments.	abstract
2021-742	The problem is well-motivated -- the interface can observe users' gaze (eg via a webcam image), predict a character as an action, and bandit feedback can be collected by observing whether users use the backspace key after the interface's action.	abstract
2021-742	Prior work showed that gaze-to-text can be less burdensome than typing, but this can quickly become untrue the more mistakes the interface makes.	abstract
2021-742	So, the goal is to personalize the interaction policy so that it makes fewer mistakes than the default interaction policy trained using a fixed dataset of expert demonstrations. <sep>	abstract
2021-742	The high-point of the paper is the empirical user study with 12-60 participants -- the study convincingly demonstrates that indeed a simple bandit algorithm can improve over the default interface; moreover, users exhibit intriguing co-adaptation patterns with the adaptive interfaces.	strength
2021-742	These findings may prove to be an interesting point for future studies in user co-adaptation. <sep>	strength

2021-742	There is a vast literature on bandit/RL algorithms, and incorporating human feedback into their operation (the paper rightly cites TAMER, COACH, etc.)	weakness
2021-742	but it is very unclear why any one of these algorithms could not be used for the paper's application.	weakness
2021-742	COACH (human feedback gives an explicit view of the action's advantage -- which in the contextual bandit setting exactly matches the paper's assumptions) seems particularly appropriate.	weakness
2021-742	Although the algorithm proposed in the paper is simple, how applicable is it in any other context?	weakness
2021-742	how does it compare to COACH/etc.?	weakness
2021-742	when should we prefer this algorithm over others?	weakness
2021-742	Furthermore, given that X2T trains a reward model from observed user-behavior, a natural baseline would use an epsilon-greedy strategy (fraction of the time, pick actions greedily according to the reward model) -- this might isolate the benefit of the approximately Boltzmann exploration being conducted on top of the reward estimates in Eqn 2.	weakness
2021-742	Finally, since X2T trains a reward model per user it could be particularly informative to visualize what the models have learned to illustrate qualitatively how X2T is personalizing across its user base. <sep>	suggestion
2021-742	The paper could have a much bigger impact if the authors can figure out some creative way to enable the broader research community to work on this problem domain.	suggestion

2021-766	This paper was controversial amongst the reviewers.	misc
2021-766	There is clear utility to the *CONF* community: a new model of grid cells based on well-known technique (SR) used frequently in ML; good science---careful analysis showing the proposed model exhibits key properties and useful in synthetic navigation domains;  such work reminds of the important concerns in natural learning systems which is relevant to those that wish to simulate and build intelligence.	strength
2021-766	Two of the reviewers with subject matter experience in the area advocated for acceptance. <sep>	rating_summary
2021-766	On the other hand, many readers of *CONF* may find the paper confusing and unsatisfying as some of the reviewers did.	weakness
2021-766	The empirical work was limited to small domains and mostly in the form of demonstrations---a typically *CONF* reader would expect a performance improvement claim or a scientific hypothesis tested by each experiment.	weakness
2021-766	Presented as a new algorithm for ML the paper might appear too limited and simple (eg, relying on state aggregation).	weakness
2021-766	The reviewers with neuro background found the paper clear and well organized, while the ML reviewers found it confusing.	weakness
2021-766	The relevance of the work will be limited to a smaller subset of researchers---but this is true of many ML works also.	weakness
2021-766	Finally, ML readers might be more familar with neuro work which propose computational models and then validate those models against real neural activity data from brains.	weakness
2021-766	This is work is not like that, rather using synthetic data to demonstrate important properties and explore empirical conjectures about the model. <sep>	weakness
2021-766	In the end the paper is boarder line: the subject matter experts both listed issues that should be addressed (eg, band cells issue), while the reaction of the ML reviewers suggests the impact of the work might be reduced at *CONF* (compared to other venues).	weakness
2021-766	Additional text clearly articulating the scope and managing reader expectation could mitigate this concern, but it's not a small task to change the tone and pitch this way.	weakness

2021-910	In addition, the AC noted that the technical aspect was lacking: <sep> 	weakness
2021-910	Training with contrastive loss on a single video may likely overfit the embedding to the video, which leads to a meaningless embedding where all non-neighboring segments are orthogonal in the embedding space.	weakness
2021-910	While changing the softmax temperature can yield higher entropy transition probabilities, the induced probability distribution is probably highly noisy.	weakness
2021-910	It would be better to train this on a large video corpus, which will prevent overfitting.	suggestion
2021-910	Also contrastive loss is typically used to build a discriminative embedding space for classification/recognition, not a smooth embedding space for generation (where distances between embedding vectors are strongly correlated to similarity).	weakness
2021-910	Thus some other embedding smoothness terms could be added during contrastive learning. <sep>	suggestion
2021-910	The learning is only on the transition probabilities, while the video generation is separate.	weakness
2021-910	It would have been more convincing to learn the transition probabilities with the video generation process in an end-to-end manner.	suggestion
2021-910	Perhaps a discriminator could be placed after the video generator so that the transition probabilities could be learned so as to better mimic real video.	suggestion

2021-1209	This paper proposes a method for differentiable pruning that replaces the hard thresholding of standard pruning, with a soft version that permits taking the gradients of the pruning threshold.	abstract
2021-1209	The proposed benefits are an accuracy that is better or competitive with alternative methods as well.	abstract
2021-1209	Moreover, the paper suggests the technique to be efficient. <sep>	abstract
2021-1209	The pros of this paper are that it is working in an interesting setting of differentiable pruning, with the hope of -- in some sense -- simplifying the pruning process or at least unifying the process with standard training.	strength
2021-1209	The technique is plausibly justified in its technical development.	strength
2021-1209	The paper also follows with a significant number of experiments. <sep>	strength
2021-1209	The cons of this paper are that the conceptual framework -- beyond the initial idea -- is not fully clear.	weakness
2021-1209	In particular, this paper does not elucidate a clear set of claims and hence, results in the difficulty on the Reviewers part in detangling the claims and identifying the appropriate comparisons. <sep>	weakness
2021-1209	For example, the paper doesn't take up a simple claim that it is state-of-the-art in accuracy vs parameter measures (and would seem not to given the results of Renda et al (2020)).	weakness
2021-1209	It need not necessarily make this claim, but there are suggestions to such a claim early in the paper.	weakness
2021-1209	If this is not an intended claim, then the paper can remove any suggestions to such (ie, the claims around new SoTA for networks not evaluated in prior work). <sep>	suggestion
2021-1209	The paper has a somewhat tentative claim that it is more efficient (in the total number of epochs of training) versus other techniques (Table 3).	weakness
2021-1209	However, the presented results are only at a single-point versus other methods.	weakness
2021-1209	Renda et al (2020) directly consider accuracy versus retraining cost trade-offs.	weakness
2021-1209	Appendix E of that paper provides one-shot pruning results for ResNet-50 showing accuracy on par with that presented here.	weakness
2021-1209	The number of retraining epochs is also similar to here.	weakness
2021-1209	This paper, however, only compares against the most expensive iterative pruning data point in the other paper. <sep>	weakness
2021-1209	In sum, my recommendation is Reject.	decision
2021-1209	This is promising work that needs only (1) to include a few testable claims and (2) to re-organize the results (and perhaps run a limited set of new results) to thoroughly explore those claims.	suggestion
2021-1209	For example, if the most important claim is accuracy vs retraining cost, then it needs to show a more complete trade-off curve of the two results.	suggestion
2021-1209	Of course, this, in principle, opens the door to comparisons to many other techniques in the literature.	suggestion

2021-1215	The paper analyzes the space of mixed sample data augmentation approaches, and proposes a new variant, FMix, based on a new masking strategy.	abstract

2021-1327	Also the reported performance in comparison to two baselines is good (although I have concerns about the selection of the baselines—see below).	strength
2021-1327	Acceptance of the paper was suggested by 3 of the reviewers and rejection by one of the reviewers.	rating_summary
2021-1327	While I don't share all concerns of the negative reviewer, I also suggest to reject the paper. <sep>	decision
2021-1327	My suggestion to reject the paper is mainly based on seeing concerns of the positive reviewers more critical as these reviewers themselves and some concerns I have on my own.	decision
2021-1327	In particular, I don't think that all MARL approaches can simply be discarded for comparison—no matter whether the opponents are learning or not.	weakness
2021-1327	Regarding the evaluation, I think that an environment with real opponents must be considered and that robustness is a key property that should be studied (otherwise an approach with a fixed set of best response policies and inference about the opponent might perform as well).	suggestion
2021-1327	In that regard I also find the selection of baselines insufficient—the minimum I would expect is to consider a NOM baseline using an RNN (which as far as I can tell is not the case) such that it could make inferences about the opponent. <sep>	weakness
2021-1327	I want to acknowledge that the paper improved quite a lot during the rebuttal period in which the authors extended their discussion of related work on opponent modeling. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1327	In summary, the paper could be improved substantially by an extended empirically study (more environments + baselines + "mismatch" settings).	weakness
2021-1327	If the currently observed performance gains also hold in these settings, this can become a good paper but in its current form I think the paper is not demonstrating that the proposed approach performs favorably over natural baselines and works well against real opponents.	weakness

2021-1334	Summary of discussions: R1 was positive on the paper in their initial evaluation, and although dissatisfied with the author's feedback, continued to support the paper.	rebuttal_process
2021-1334	I agree with R1's assessment that other reviewers' call for more theory is somewhat unfair, considering the fact that very similar papers don't usually include theoretical justification beyond intuitive motivation. <sep>	ac_disagreement
2021-1334	By contrast, R3 is the most negative on the paper, leaning towards rejection.	rating_summary
2021-1334	The main concern is that open questions remain as to whether the reported performance can be attributed to the architecture, or the loss function proposed.	weakness
2021-1334	This is an important point to clarify, and further ablation studies would make the paper stronger. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1334	After considering the strengths and weaknesses of this work, the final decision was to reject.	decision
2021-1334	Authors are encouraged to improve this promising work and resubmit to a future venue.	decision

2021-1336	The paper proposes an intriguing approach for "individual treatment effect" estimation from an observational dataset.	abstract
2021-1336	The approach is developed for multiple discrete actions (beyond binary treatments as typically studied in ITE literature) and discrete outcomes (a special case compared to related literature).	abstract
2021-1336	The idea is to use the "direct method" (ie learn a probabilistic classifier using the observed dataset) and sample imputed outcomes for all unobserved action-outcomes.	abstract
2021-1336	Then, learn a probabilistic classifier that fits the observed+imputed dataset well, and iterate the procedure.	abstract
2021-1336	This intriguing idea seems to converge empirically on a few different problems, and sampling the imputations rather than using deterministic imputations seems to be an important detail. <sep>	abstract
2021-1336	Proof of convergence is however shown for deterministic imputations.	weakness
2021-1336	The generalization error bound (Theorem 1) also does not show adequate motivation for the proposed method -- even with infinite data (n->infinity), the excess risk could scale with the empirical risk of the returned model on the imputed dataset.	weakness
2021-1336	Without an additional step proving that empirical risk on hat{D} (the imputed dataset) converges to 0 during successive iterations of the procedure, the generalization error bound is incomplete. <sep>	weakness
2021-1336	Consider the example of Figure 1, but where customer A has arrived to the system twice.	weakness
2021-1336	So, the dataset contains {x1, $2, 1} and {x1, $3, 0}.	weakness
2021-1336	When constructing the imputed dataset, the first data-point would create 2 regression examples {x1, $1,.}	weakness
2021-1336	and {x1, $3,.}	weakness
2021-1336	while the second data-point would create 2 regression examples {x1, $1,.}	weakness
2021-1336	and {x1, $2,.}. <sep>	weakness
2021-1336	Now, if the two {x1, $1,.}	weakness
2021-1336	examples have different imputation labels sampled from the model, this sets up an unrealizable learning problem and the empirical risk on hat{D} cannot be 0 for any predictor. <sep>	weakness
2021-1336	In this toy example, we might know that we should "collapse" the two data-points (eg, de-duplicate the dataset to only have unique x's with aggregated action-outcomes across all observations) in the original data-set and only create one set of imputed labels -- but similar unrealizability can happen for x's that are "close" to each other that no model has capacity to label them differently. <sep>	weakness
2021-1336	The strength of the paper is its intriguing approach to ITE estimation.	strength
2021-1336	It is a form of an iterative S-learner (vanilla S-learners have been widely used in ITE estimation). <sep>	strength
2021-1336	The low-point of the paper is this weakness in theory and analysis -- it is unclear if the proposed procedure with sampling imputations (which seems to be important for empirical performance) is even a consistent algorithm. <sep>	weakness
2021-1336	The paper would be much stronger with a more rigorous analysis of when the method will reliably work, and importantly, its limitations -- such a study will help practitioners know when to use self-training over direct method, targeted max likelihood, S-learners, etc.	suggestion

2021-1355	The authors study "robustness curves" which are plots of the robust error versus the radius used in the corresponding l_p-ball threat model. <sep>	abstract
2021-1355	Pro: I completely agree with the authors that the current evaluation purely based on evaluation for a single radius is insufficient and one should report the complete curve. <sep>	strength
2021-1355	Con: The authors are overclaiming that they have come up with robustness curves.	weakness
2021-1355	Very early papers eg even in the adversarial training paper of Madry there are plots of robust accuracy versus chosen threshold.	weakness
2021-1355	Moreover, I agree with one of the reviewers that using PGD for the purpose of a robustness curve is inaccurate and in particular inefficient as several attacks for different radii have to be done.	weakness
2021-1355	There have been several attacks developed which aim to find the adversarial sample with minimum norm and thus compute the robustness curve in one run. <sep>	weakness
2021-1355	The additional insights eg intersection of robustness curves are partially to be expected and I don't find them sufficient to move the paper over the bar for *CONF*.	decision
2021-1355	As these insights are additionally  only shown for relatively small models which seem far away from the state of the art, it is unclear if they generalize.	weakness
2021-1355	However, I encourage to follow some of the reviewer's suggestions to improve the paper.	suggestion

2021-1379	This promising work proves that the proposed contrastive learning approach to representation learning can recover the underlying topic posterior information given standard topic modelling assumptions.	abstract
2021-1379	The work provides detailed proof and detailed experiments.	strength
2021-1379	The analysis is interesting and yields interesting insights.	strength
2021-1379	However, the experimental results are somewhat weak by lacking comparison with more recent document representation work. <sep>	weakness

2021-1379	Interesting idea of using topic modelling to understand representation learning.<sep>	strength
2021-1379	Cons: <sep> The description of DirectNCE is somewhat hidden and could be better introduced in the paper. <sep> 	weakness
2021-1379	Experimental baselines are weak lacking a comparison to recent document representation work such as Arora et al 2019. <sep>	weakness
2021-1379	Stronger classification baselines could be incorporated.	weakness

2021-1396	This paper addresses the real-world problem of semi-supervised learning where the distribution from which the labeled examples are drawn is different from the distribution from which the unlabeled examples are drawn.	abstract
2021-1396	The task is motivated by structure-activity prediction for drug design (quantitative structure activity prediction, or QSAR).	abstract
2021-1396	Examples represent molecules, and we wish to predict a real-valued measure of binding affinity.	weakness
2021-1396	Exactly the general problem of data skew arose with exactly this task for example in one of the KDD Cup 2001 tasks.	weakness
2021-1396	While the authors here mention that labeled data may be focused more on active molecules (those with a high continuous-valued response), in the KDD Cup 200`1 data the reverse was true, and the unlabeled test data were skewed to higher activity level.	weakness
2021-1396	I say all this to agree with the authors about the real-world nature of the problem they address.	misc
2021-1396	Also, some reviewers felt more empirical evaluation was needed, so that may be an additional data set for the authors to consider using. <sep>	weakness
2021-1396	Reviewer concerns including that the approach was simplistic, the empirical results were insufficient, and the claims were oversold.	weakness
2021-1396	The author replies and revisions, and the discussion, moved the reviews to be more favorable but still not strong enough to justify acceptance yet.	decision
2021-1396	Nevertheless, the consensus is that the paper addresses an important problem and the revisions are headed in the right direction to make a strong future paper, and that the authors should be encouraged to continue this work.	misc

2021-1408	The paper received 5 reviews, one of which had positive feedback.	rating_summary
2021-1408	Although there are merits associated with the paper, several concerns raised in the reviews and the discussion period that prevents the paper to be accepted.	rebuttal_process
2021-1408	It appears that experiments on noisy graphs are not properly done and competitive baselines are not used for validations.	weakness
2021-1408	The quality of the learned graph structure is not adequately analyzed.	weakness

2021-1413	Fundamental problem with training only on one dataset (MNIST), issue with possible overfitting.	weakness

2021-1430	The paper proposed a two-stage method to select instances from a set, involving candidate selection (learning a function  to determine a Bernoulli probability for each input) and AutoRegressive subset selection (learning a function  to generate probabilities for sampling elements from a reduced set); both stages use the Concrete distribution to ensure differentiability.	abstract
2021-1430	The experiments show the performance of the proposed method on several use-cases, including reconstruction of an image from a subset of its pixels, selecting sparse features for a classification task, and dataset distillation for few-shot classification.	abstract
2021-1430	I read the paper and I agree with the reviewers that in its current format the paper is hard to follow.	weakness
2021-1430	I strongly encourage the authors to add more discussion and intuition on the proposed method and extend the experiments with more baseline comparison and ablation studies in the revised version.	suggestion

2021-1443	The paper proposes a fast, nearly-linear time, algorithm for finding a sparsifier for general directed and undirected graphs that approximately preserves the spectral properties of the original graph.	abstract
2021-1443	The reviewers appreciated the main contribution of the paper, but they were concerned about the correctness and clarity of the paper, as well as the relevance of the contribution to machine learning.	weakness
2021-1443	Following the discussion with the authors, the reviewers still felt that these concerns had not been fully addressed by the authors' responses and the subsequent revision of the paper.	rebuttal_process
2021-1443	After taking these concerns into account as well as evaluating the paper relative to other *CONF* submissions, I recommend reject.	decision

2021-1494	The authors study the problem of (insufficient) generalization in gossip-type decentralized deep learning.	abstract
2021-1494	Specifically, they establish an upper bound on the square of the consensus parameter distance, which the authors identify as a key quantity that influences both optimization and generalization.	abstract
2021-1494	This upper bound (called the critical consensus distance) can be monitored and controlled during the training process via (eg) learning rate scheduling and tweaking the amount of gossip.	abstract
2021-1494	A series of empirical results on decentralized image classification and neural machine translation are presented in support of this observation. <sep>	abstract
2021-1494	Initial reviews were mixed.	misc
2021-1494	While all reviewers liked the approach, concerns were raised about the novelty of the results, the lack of theoretical depth, and the mismatch between theory and experiments.	weakness
2021-1494	Overall, the idea of tracking consensus distance to control generalization seems to be a practically useful concept.	strength
2021-1494	During the discussion phase the authors were been able to (convincingly, in the area chair's view) respond to a subset of the criticisms. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1494	Unfortunately, concerns remained regarding the mismatch between the theoretical and empirical results, and in the end the paper fell just short of making the cut. <sep>	decision

2021-1499	The authors present a method for self-supervised learning of representations of 2D projections of 3D objects.	abstract
2021-1499	By performing known 3D transformations of an object of interest, a encoder/decoder network is trained to estimate the applied transformation from a series of 2D projections.	abstract
2021-1499	The proposed method is used as a regularizer and experiments are performed on supervised 3D object classification and retrieval. <sep>	abstract
2021-1499	After seeing each others' reviews, one of the main concerns from the reviewers was the relationship between the proposed method and Zhang et al, CVPR 2019 (ie AET).	weakness
2021-1499	The two methods are conceptually very similar, and the consensus from the reviewers is that the authors did not acknowledge the overlap sufficiently and also did not provide a convincing argument as to why they think the approaches are different. <sep>	weakness
2021-1499	In their rebuttal the authors provided some additional results on real data which is a valuable and welcome addition.	rebuttal_process
2021-1499	However, there were still other concerns that the reviewers had eg R2 wanted to know why the model could not be applied directly to 3D shapes instead of 2D projections. <sep>	rebuttal_process

2021-1513	Like the reviewers, I find this paper extremely borderline.	misc
2021-1513	On the one hand, it is clearly written, about a topic I find fascinating, and generally well motivated if not shockingly novel (ie removing some of the simplifying assumptions from Zhong et al 2020, eg requiring grounding to be learned, use of real language rather than synthetically generated).	strength
2021-1513	On the other hand, I agree with the leitmotiv present amongst the reviews that the problem at the centre of the experimental setting is very, very simple (3 objects, 3 descriptions).	weakness
2021-1513	I am mindful of the fact that access to computational resources is unevenly distributed, and am not expecting a paper like this to immediately scale their experiments to highly complex settings with photorealism, etc, but I can't help but feel that a more challenging task, with a deeper analysis of the problems presented by both grounding and the use of non-synthetic language, would both have been highly desirable to make this paper uncontroversially worth accepting. <sep>	weakness
2021-1513	As a result, the decision is to not accept the paper in its present form.	decision
2021-1513	Work on this topic should definitely be presented at *CONF*, but it's a shame this paper did not make a stronger case for itself.	misc

2021-1516	This paper proposes an interesting new direction for low-cost NAS.	abstract
2021-1516	However, the paper is not quite ready for acceptance in its current form.	decision
2021-1516	The main area of improvement is around the generalizability of the score presented, both empirically and (ideally) theoretically.	weakness
2021-1516	The two main directions of generalizability that would be worth investigating are 1) different image datasets (see comments around Imagenet-16) 2) different/larger search spaces.	weakness
2021-1516	Even simple search spaces consisting of a few architectural modification starting from standard architectures (eg resnets) would go a long way in convincing the community that the proposed method generalizes past NasBench.	weakness

2021-1524	The paper studies personalized federated learning, mixing a global model with locally trained models.	abstract
2021-1524	Reviewers agreed on the relevance of the problem and that the work contains valuable contributions, such as the generalization bounds. <sep>	strength
2021-1524	After discussion, unfortunately consensus remained that the paper remains narrowly below the bar in the current form. <sep>	rating_summary

2021-1550	Like several reviewers, I found the causal framing to be confusing, or at least not really to be framed in a framework like Pearl's: the word "confounding" is thrown a few times in the manuscript, but there is no formal sense by which it is linked to what we commonly understand as confounding.	weakness
2021-1550	We are still talking about what happens inside a predictive model (a deterministic function), not what happens in the real world (the authors are not alone as targets of my observation: my point applies to a lot of the papers in the references, where the causal interpretation is hardly illuminating for those coming from a causal inference background, for instance).	weakness
2021-1550	The reply to Reviewer 2, for instance, cites [1], which is about Granger causality and has little to do with Pearl's framework.	weakness
2021-1550	Despite its name, Granger "causality" is a probabilistic concept (or, at best, an idea for identifying non-causality) with a very minimal causal basis besides the use of time ordering.	weakness
2021-1550	A much more rigorous explanation of confounding in this paper's context needs to be provided. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1550	That been said: as helpfully highlighted by Reviewer 3 (and summarized without any need to resort to a causal framing), there are several positive contributions added here, which might be of interest to the *CONF* audience.	strength

2021-1566	On behalf of the reviewers, I would like to thank the authors for addressing many concerns raised in the initial reviews.	misc
2021-1566	Unfortunately, a further examination revealed several other potential issues that require further clarification: <sep> It seems that real-data experiments do not really demonstrate whether the benefits of the approach come from multi-task learning or from permutation invariance.	weakness

2021-1589	The paper makes an attempt towards byzantine resilient federated learning, in the pressneece of backdoor attacks. <sep>	abstract
2021-1589	The method presented combines a clustering step with a poison elimination step, and seems to be effective against a range of current attacks. <sep>	abstract
2021-1589	Both steps are a bit ad hoc in nature, and do not come with provable guarantees. <sep>	weakness
2021-1589	Moreover, the algorithms presented will have a big negative impact on personalization as several models may be incorrectly discarded during and FL round. <sep>	weakness
2021-1589	The authors further point in their response that " no existing defense against backdoor attacks preserves the privacy of the clients' data."	rebuttal_process
2021-1589	This is in fact not true, as the differential privacy defense presented by the "Can you really backdoor FL" paper is in fact fully respective of user privacy. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1589	At the same time, the work on backdoor attacks and defenses is reminiscent of the "cat and mouse" work in adversarial examples: an attack comes out, then a defense claims to protect against it, then an attack that incorporates that defense can be made stronger, and so on.	weakness
2021-1589	This is similar in the context of backdoor attacks. <sep>	weakness
2021-1589	In fact, a recent work [1] proposes that detecting backdoors is in the general computationally unlikely, rendering the generality of the proposed algorithm questionable, and also suggest a set of attacks that seem very hard to defend against.	weakness

2021-1597	The reviewers agree that this paper has some interesting ideas.	strength
2021-1597	However, they believe it needs more work before it is ready for publication, especially so with regards to presentation (SDEs as GANs) and the experiments (backpropagating through the solver rather than using the adjoint dynamics).	rating_summary

2021-1664	The paper presents a hierarchical version of NMF for the CP decomposition of tensors. <sep>	abstract
2021-1664	The idea is similar to Chinocki et al 2007 and extends Gao et al 2019, and in Chinocki was presented for the standard linear formulation with regularisation terms.	abstract
2021-1664	The extension here doesn't use the standard ALS algorithm but rather presents a neural network analogue, though the functions are still linear, its just that back-prop etc.	abstract
2021-1664	are used for the computation.	abstract
2021-1664	The authors point out their formulation is a more flexible representation and optimisation (in response to AnonReviewer5), and thus represents an improvement.	abstract
2021-1664	While this is an interesting implementation, in NNs, the model is still fairly simple. <sep>	weakness
2021-1664	Moreover the experimental results are restricted to a few data sets.	weakness
2021-1664	There are literally hundreds of NMF variants in publication and many different evaluations are done.	weakness
2021-1664	The experimental work here, while showcasing the work, is not extensive.	weakness
2021-1664	For instance, more empirical comparisons should have been made against prior hierarchical NMF on a battery of data. <sep>	weakness
2021-1664	So this is good, publishable work, and the authors have repaired many of the issues raised by the reviewers.	rebuttal_process

2021-1674	This work studies the question of universal approximation with neural networks under general symmetries.	abstract
2021-1674	For this purpose, the authors first leverage existing universal approximation results with shallow fully connected networks defined on infinite-dimensional input spaces, that are then upgraded to provide Universal Approximation of group-equivariant functions using group equivariant  convolutional networks. <sep>	abstract
2021-1674	Reviewers were all appreciative of the scope of this paper, aimed at unifying different UAT results under the same underlying 'master theorem', bringing a much more general perspective on the problem of learning under symmetry.	strength
2021-1674	However, reviewers also expressed concerns about the accessibility and readibility of the current manuscript, pointing at the lack of examples and connections with existing models/results.	weakness
2021-1674	Authors did a commendable job at adding these examples and incorporating reviewers feedback into a much improved revision. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1674	After taking all the feedback into account, this AC has the uncomfortable job of recommending rejection at this time.	decision
2021-1674	Ultimately, the reason is that this AC is convinced that this paper can be made even better by doing an extra revision that helps the reader navigate through the levels of generality.	weakness
2021-1674	As it turns out, this paper was reviewed by three top senior experts at the interface of ML and groups/invariances, who themselves found that the treatment could be made more accessible --- thus hinting a difficult read for non-experts.	weakness
2021-1674	In particular, the main result of this work (theorem 9) is based on a rather intuitive idea (that one can leverage UAT for generic neural nets on the generator of an equivariant function), that requires some technical 'care' in order to be fleshed out.	weakness
2021-1674	The essence of the proof can be conveyed in simple terms, after which following through the proof is much easier.	weakness
2021-1674	Similarly, the paper quickly adopts an abstract (yet precise) formalism in terms of infinite-dimensional domains, which again clouds the essential ideas in technical details.	weakness
2021-1674	While the paper now contains several examples, this AC believes the authors can go to the extra mile of connecting them together, and further discussing the shortcomings of the result --- in particular, the remarks on tensor representations and the invariant case are of great importance in practice, and should be discussed more prominently.	weakness
2021-1674	Finally, while this work is only concerned with universal approximation, an important aspect that is not mentioned here is the quantitative counterpart, ie what are the approximation rates for symmetric functions under the considered models.	weakness

2021-1703	The paper proposes a novel way to have weight decay-like update rule.	abstract
2021-1703	Empirically, the authors claim that it improves generalization when applied to momentum-based optimizers and optimizers with coordinate-wise learning rates. <sep>	abstract
2021-1703	This paper has been thoroughly discussed, both in public and private mode. <sep>	misc
2021-1703	The strength of this paper lies in the possible gain in generalization performance due the proposed change. <sep>	strength
2021-1703	The weaknesses are: <sep> the very confusing and not scientific motivation of the proposed change <sep> 	weakness
2021-1703	the experiments are not fully convincing<sep>	weakness
2021-1703	More in details, we all found the discussion on "stable" and "unstable" weight decay extremely confusing.	weakness
2021-1703	The claim of the paper is that "stable" weight decay should be preferred over "unstable" one.	weakness
2021-1703	However, to validate a scientific claim it is necessary to carry out an empirical or theoretical evaluation.	weakness
2021-1703	The theoretical one is simply missing: a number of proposition and corollaries are stated with some simple mathematical facts completely disconnected from the optimization or generalization issues.	weakness
2021-1703	As it is, removing these arguments would actually make the paper better. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1703	On the empirical side, there is no experiment that supports the simple claim that "the unstable weight decay problem may undesirably damage performance".	weakness
2021-1703	Instead, what we see are experiments in which the modified update rule seem to perform better, but they don't actually show that "stability" or "instability" are the specific issues at play here.	weakness
2021-1703	Indeed, any other explanation is equally valid and the experiments do not support any specific one, but rather they can only support the claim that the proposed algorithm might be better than some other optimization algorithms.	weakness
2021-1703	The specific reason why this is happening is not clear. <sep>	weakness
2021-1703	Turning to the empirical evaluation, the discussion elicited the fact that, a part for CIFAR10, the experiments are carried out without tuning of the learning rates.	weakness
2021-1703	Hence, it is difficult for us to even validate the claim of superiority of the method.	weakness
2021-1703	I don't subscribe to the idea that a deep learning paper requires experiments on ImageNet to be valid.	weakness
2021-1703	Yet, given that there is no supporting theory in this paper, the empirical evaluation should be solid and thorough. <sep>	weakness
2021-1703	For the above reasons, the paper cannot be published at *CONF*.	decision

2021-1710	This paper proposes a method for predicting higher-order structure in time-varying graphs.	abstract
2021-1710	The paper was reviewed by three expert reviewers, and while they expressed appreciation for the sensible solution, they have remaining concerns about the novel contributions and comparisons (analytical and empirical) with previous approaches.	weakness
2021-1710	Also, the paper would be clearer if examples are used to illustrate the important points of the paper.	weakness
2021-1710	The authors are encouraged to continue research, taking into consideration the detailed comments provided by the reviewers.	suggestion

2021-1714	While the submission has promising components, the reviewers were not able to reach a consensus to recommend acceptance.	rating_summary
2021-1714	The main concerns is that (1) theorem statements and assumptions are not clearly explained, and (2) the novelty of the approach is not made clear, and (3) there remain concerns on whether the experimental results are due to hyperparameter search or improvements due to the model.	weakness

2021-1723	The authors investigate different tokenization methods for the translation between French and Fon (an African low-resource language).	abstract

2021-1723	Unfortunately, the reviewers unanimously agree that this work might be better suited for a different conference, for example LREC, since the machine learning contributions are small.	rating_summary
2021-1723	The AC encourages the authors to consider submitting this work to LREC or a similar conference.	decision

2021-1737	The paper proposed a useful incremental extension to the monotonic GMM attention by incorporating source content. <sep>	abstract
2021-1737	It has shown comparable performance for online and long-form speech recognition, but falls behind on the machine translation task.	abstract
2021-1737	For online ASR, it would be more convincing to include latency comparisons across different streaming models besides WERs. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1737	The presentation of the paper can be further improved although it already got better based on reviewers' comments. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1737	As in the discussion, a more accurate description of the method would be "multi-head Gaussian attention" instead of GMM attention. <sep>	weakness
2021-1737	The main factor for the decision is limited novelty and clarity can be further improved.	weakness

2021-1738	This paper proposes a method for neural architecture search (NAS) based on adversarial methods.	abstract
2021-1738	It uses a discriminator trained to distinguish between random vs. good architectures, letting the discriminator's scores serve as a reward signal for an autoregressive generator.	abstract
2021-1738	I agree with AR1: this is a nice and clever idea.	strength
2021-1738	Reviewers generally agreed that the method was interesting, eg it's quite flexible in that it's able to incorporate constraints, and that the evaluation is rather extensive and shows that the method performs well across the board.	strength
2021-1738	Many minor criticisms were raised and addressed well by the authors in their responses and manuscript updates. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-1738	The major criticism shared by most reviewers was the high methodological complexity of the proposed approach, and the proportionally small gains shown over much simpler baselines.	weakness
2021-1738	This criticism remained despite the authors' responses.	rebuttal_process
2021-1738	The method is indeed complex: the same method without any adversarial component already performs well, and many important details of the model are relegated to Appendix A.2.	rebuttal_process
2021-1738	(I would recommend, for example, moving Fig.	suggestion
2021-1738	2 to the main text if at all possible.	suggestion
2021-1738	Also, the Appendix can/should be included in the main PDF for *CONF*, rather than in supplementary material, as AR1 mentions.)	suggestion
2021-1738	It was not clear to reviewers that the adversarial component of the approach has a significant benefit.	rebuttal_process
2021-1738	The authors respond by pointing to Table 7 showing that the discriminator reduces the number of queries and points out that in reality these queries correspond to expensive evaluations.	rebuttal_process
2021-1738	If this is a major selling point of the method (it sounds like it could be), it should be highlighted and analyzed far more -- at least moved to the main text rather than an Appendix -- ideally with a real-world evaluation showing a practical large improvement in overall wall-clock time, rather than a benchmark where these evaluations are free.	suggestion
2021-1738	Perhaps the exclusive reliance on these benchmarks, though undoubtedly useful for quick experimentation, in the end holds back the paper and prevents the method's benefits from becoming apparent to the readers. <sep>	weakness
2021-1738	As a minor point (also raised by AR1), the paper is formatted incorrectly for *CONF*: the font color is off, and more importantly the PDF is unsearchable (text cannot be selected, ctrl-F does not work), which makes it very difficult to quickly reference and review.	weakness
2021-1738	Please try not to stray from the conference-provided style file for future submissions. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1738	I appreciate the cleverness of the method, the extent of the evaluation, and the thorough responses to the reviews.	strength
2021-1738	However, unfortunately with the current presentation, it is too difficult to discern the benefit of the proposed approach from the manuscript.	weakness
2021-1738	The approach is nonetheless intuitively appealing and seems quite promising, and I hope the authors will take the reviewers' good feedback into account and resubmit the paper in the future.	decision

2021-1739	There are two main contributions in this paper.	misc
2021-1739	First, the use of NN from the same cluster as "views" of the data as understood in classical contrastive learning.	strength
2021-1739	Second, the use of additional augmentation techniques, namely cutMix and multi-resolution.	strength
2021-1739	The reviewers noted that the paper is written well and easy to understand, that the ablation study is conducted well and that the model shows good empirical performance on several tasks. <sep>	strength
2021-1739	At the same time, the somewhat limited novelty of the paper was also discussed.	weakness
2021-1739	As noted by R4, all aspects of the present paper have been discussed in previous work.	weakness
2021-1739	The difference with previously published clustering-based SSL methods was also not very clear.	weakness
2021-1739	This was discussed in the rebuttal but without strong evidence supporting the claims.	rebuttal_process
2021-1739	Moreover, the ablation study is conducted on models that are trained for 200 epochs.	weakness
2021-1739	While this is understandable from a pragmatic point of view, the conclusions may be completely different when the model is fully optimised. <sep>	weakness
2021-1739	Because of all the points raised in the discussions, this paper is a too close to borderline to be accepted.	decision
2021-1739	We recommend the authors improve the manuscript given the feedback provided in the reviews and discussion and resubmit to another venue.	decision

2021-1806	The authors propose a new approach to topology optimization to address over-smoothing in GCNs.	abstract
2021-1806	This is a borderline paper.	rating_summary
2021-1806	Topology optimization is clearly important and relevant and the approach tries to optimize the topology (add/delete edges) by viewing the problem as a latent variable model and aiming to optimize the graph together with the GCN parameters to maximize the likelihood of observed node labels.	strength
2021-1806	A number of related joint topology optimization approaches exist, however, as discussed in the reviews and the responses.	rebuttal_process
2021-1806	The proposed methodology is termed variational EM but is a bit heuristic in the sense that E and M steps do not follow a consistent criterion (the direction of KL is flipped between the steps).	weakness
2021-1806	A number of comparisons are provided with consistent gains though the gains appear relatively small.	weakness
2021-1806	No error bars are provided despite request to add them to better assess the significance of these results.	weakness
2021-1806	It remains unclear whether the gains are worth the added complexity.	weakness

2021-1822	This paper shows that linear layers can be replaced by butterfly networks.	abstract

2021-1830	The authors propose a pretraining strategy learning inductive biases in transformers for deduction, induction, and abduction.	abstract
2021-1830	Further, the claims and results seem to indicate that such pretraining is more successful in transformers which provide a more malleable architecture for learning inductive (structural) biases.	abstract
2021-1830	There are open questions that remain, specifically surrounding disentangling high performance from structural bias learning (ie is pretraining doing what we think it is) and whether datasets are the "correct" mechanism for imparting such biases/knowledge.	weakness

2021-1832	The paper proposes a unification of three popular baseline regularizers in continual learning.	abstract
2021-1832	The unification is realized through a claim that they all regularize (surprisingly) related objectives. <sep>	abstract
2021-1832	The key strengths of the paper highlighted by the reviewers were: <sep> The established connection is valuable and interesting, even if weaker than suggested originally <sep> 	strength
2021-1832	Good motivation (unifying different regularization methods is useful for the community) <sep>	strength
2021-1832	Clear writing<sep>	strength
2021-1832	The key weakness of the paper is a weak empirical validation of the claim that these three regularizers work because they regularize the norm of the gradient (as mentioned in the discussion by R3).	weakness
2021-1832	Rather, the key claims are correlational.	weakness
2021-1832	The authors correctly say that (1) the three regularizers all regularize related objects (namely different norms of the gradient) and (2) they reduce forgetting.	weakness
2021-1832	However, it is not sufficiently well demonstrated that (1) => (2).	weakness
2021-1832	Relatedly, given that the paper does not have a very clear theoretical contribution, it would be really helpful to demonstrate utility.	weakness
2021-1832	It would be useful to extend experiments that apply these insights to developing novel regularizers or improving/simplifying hyperparameter tuning. <sep>	suggestion
2021-1832	Additionally, in the review process, the link was discovered to be weaker than originally suggested.	weakness
2021-1832	The paper casts the relation in terms of the Fisher Information Matrix, which suggests it is theoretical and sound.	weakness
2021-1832	After the discussion, it seems that viewing this relationship in terms of the Fisher Information Matrix is somewhat misleading.	weakness
2021-1832	The three different regularization methods all regularize different norms of the gradient (L1 or L2), which are empirically, and under some assumption theoretically, related.	weakness
2021-1832	More precisely, EWC regularizes the trace of the Empirical Fisher, which is equivalent to the L2 norm of the gradient of the loss function.	weakness
2021-1832	SI regularizes a term similar to the L1 norm of the gradient.	weakness
2021-1832	These effects were seen by the reviewers to be somewhat loosely related to the Fisher Information Matrix. <sep>	weakness
2021-1832	Based on the above, I have to recommend rejection.	decision

2021-1906	The paper proposes a new framework for online hypothesis testing aimed at detecting causal effects (of treatments on outcomes) within subgroups in online settings where treatments are randomized.	abstract
2021-1906	Such settings occur in online advertising where different versions of the same website may be presented to a set of otherwise exchangeable users via A/B testing. <sep>	abstract
2021-1906	Under the standard causal assumptions of SUTVA, and sequential ignorability, in addition to a set of regularity conditions, the authors derive a result (Theorem 1) leading to an online test (Theorem 2).	abstract
2021-1906	Since the resulting test's limiting distribution does not have an exact analytic form, the authors instead propose a bootstrap approach to determine a set of parameters to properly control the error rate. <sep>	abstract
2021-1906	The author validate their approach by a simulation study, as well as via a user click log data from Yahoo! <sep>	abstract
2021-1906	The reviewer opinion was somewhat split on this paper, in particular some reviewers raised concern about some (conceptually significant) typos, interpretability of assumptions, and the need for parametric assumptions (the dichotomy between linear models and neural networks is surely a false one -- the semi-parametric literature obtains nice parametric style results, although perhaps not always for tests, without assuming parametric likelihoods all the time).	weakness

2021-1907	This paper first makes the observation that incidental supervisory data can be used to define a new prior from which to calculate a PAC-Bayes generalization guarantee.	abstract
2021-1907	This observation can be applied to any setting where there is unsupervised or semi-supervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning on labeled data.	abstract
2021-1907	The PAC-Bayes bound is valid when applied to the fine-tuning.	abstract
2021-1907	For example, one could use an L2 bound (derived from PAC-Bayes) on the difference between the fine-tuned parameters and pre-trained parameters. <sep>	abstract
2021-1907	But the paper proposes evaluating the value of pre-training before looking at any labeled data.	abstract
2021-1907	Let π0 be the prior before unsupervised or semi-supervised training and let π~ be the prior after pre-training.	abstract
2021-1907	The paper proposes using the entropy ratio H(π0)/H(π~) as a measure of the value of the pre-training.	abstract
2021-1907	As the reviewers note, this is not really related to PAC-Bayes bounds.	weakness
2021-1907	Furthermore, it is clearly possible that the pre-training greatly focuses the prior but in a way that is detrimental to learning the task at hand. <sep>	weakness

2021-1983	Unfortunately, the reviewers do not feel that the paper, in its current state, meets the bar for *CONF*.	rating_summary
2021-1983	In particular, reviewers found the descriptions unclear and the justifications lacking.	weakness

2021-2005	This work proposes an efficient method for modelling long-range connections in point-cloud data.	abstract
2021-2005	Reviewers found the paper to be generally well-written.	strength
2021-2005	On the less positive side, reviewers felt that the novelty of the work was marginal, and that the experimentation, limited to synthetic data in one domain, was too limited.	weakness
2021-2005	These concerns remain after the discussion phase.	rebuttal_process
2021-2005	In addition, the authors stated during the discussion that "Our goal is indeed to develop an efficient strategy to model LRIs in real chemical and materials systems", which conflicts with the presentation of the work as motivated by more general point cloud modelling problems.	rebuttal_process
2021-2005	Given these weaknesses, the final decision was to reject.	decision

2021-2007	The authors proposed to pre-process the original input features into a low dimensional term and its corresponding residual term via SVD.	abstract
2021-2007	The paper empirically demonstrated the neural networks trained on such factorized exhibit faster convergence in training.	abstract
2021-2007	Several issues of clarity were addressed during the rebuttal period by the authors. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2007	However, the reviewers still felt that there were some remaining fundamental issues with the paper,<sep>	weakness
2021-2007	The motivation is not echoed in the experiments, namely most of the experiments on CIFAR and CatDog dataset using a low dimensional factorization of d=1 which is trivial and often part of the whitening preprocessing.<sep>	weakness
2021-2007	The proposed factorization via SVD will be difficult to scale up to high dimensional features, large training sets and higher d >> 1. <sep>	weakness
2021-2007	The empirical experiments show a marginal improvement in the training speed, especially in the image recognition tasks, yet there seems an early plateau in test performance when compared to the baselines.<sep>	weakness
2021-2007	The theoretical analysis in Section 2 studied linear models.	weakness
2021-2007	Yet, the rest of the paper focuses on non-linear neural networks.	weakness

2021-2016	This paper analyzes several neighbor embedding methods-- t-SNE, UMAP, and ForceAtlas2-- by considering their objectives as consisting of attractive and repulsive terms.	abstract
2021-2016	The main hypothesis is that stronger repulsive terms contribute towards learning discrete structures, while stronger attractive terms contribute towards learning continuous/manifold structures.	abstract
2021-2016	The paper empirically explored the space parameterized by the relative weighting of the attractive and repulsive terms for the t-SNE and UMAP algorithms, using several data sets, and qualitatively confirmed their conclusions about the impact of the attractive and repulsion terms as the relative weights vary. <sep>	abstract
2021-2016	The experimental validation of the paper's main hypothesis is thorough and the use of diverse data sets and neighbor embedding methods is appreciated-- as the authors point out, several reviewers missed this contribution.	rebuttal_process
2021-2016	However, several reviewers point out that the insight presented in the paper is already largely present in the literature, and that beyond its analysis the paper does not present new algorithms based on this insight.	rebuttal_process
2021-2016	The authors rebut this claim by arguing that the novelty of the paper lies in it: (1) showing the contrary to the established opinion, UMAP works despite, instead of because, it uses cross-entropy loss, and (2) the paper offers for the first time a theoretical understanding of why ForceAtlas2 highlights continuous developmental trajectories, and (3) prior work has not made the connection between UMAP, ForceAtlas2, and t-SNE or suggested using exaggeration throughout the optimization process for t-SNE rather than simply as a warm-up.	rebuttal_process
2021-2016	The paper does indeed present intuitions for (1)-(3) based on the attraction-repulsion ideas, and makes the connection between these neighbor embedding algorithms by viewing them as variations on the theme of attraction-repulsion, but these intuitions are not significant steps forward with respect to what is already known about how neighbor embeddings balance attraction and repulsion.	weakness
2021-2016	The mathematical analyses consist of stating the gradient for the algorithms and explaining how weighing the attraction and repulsion terms differently lead to different qualitative observations.	abstract
2021-2016	The use of exaggeration throughout the optimization process is straightforward, and no strong mathematical characterization of the properties of the resulting algorithm is given. <sep>	weakness
2021-2016	It is recommended that this paper be rejected, as it consists of a thorough empirical validation of an understanding of the trade-off between attractive and repulsive forces in neighbor embedding methods that was already present in the literature, along with some straightforward arguments connecting several popular neighbor embedding methods, but does not introduce any significantly new actionable insights or novel algorithms.	decision

2021-2025	This paper considers convex optimization problems whose solutions involve the solution of linear systems defined in terms of the Hessian.	abstract
2021-2025	It presents algorithms that reduce the runtime of standard iterative approaches to solving these problems by iteratively sketching the Hessian; the novelty lies in the fact that the authors use the idea of learned sketches which have been used prior for problems in data mining.	abstract
2021-2025	In particular, the authors use the approach to learning sketches of Liu et al, 2020 to learn the entries in sparse sketching matrices for the Hessian, and propose using the Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms of Pilanci and Wainright, 2016 to iteratively solve the concerned optimization problem.	abstract
2021-2025	The advantages of learned sketches are that they may allow using smaller sketch sizes while making progress on the problem, as they are learned to work well on the distribution of Hessians from which the problem instance is drawn. <sep>	abstract
2021-2025	The consensus of the reviews is that the idea of using learned sketches for convex optimization seems to be novel, and this paper is an interesting attempt, but falls short of the level of contribution required for publication in *CONF*.	rating_summary
2021-2025	The main concern is that the theory provided for the use of the learned sketches is incremental: the analysis does not reflect the fact that the sketches are learned; instead, the algorithm builds in a safeguard by using both a random sketch and a learned sketch, and the analysis uses the properties of the random sketch to proceed.	weakness
2021-2025	The empirical results are suggestive, but the convergence rates of the learned and random sketches do not vary much, so the benefits seem marginal for most of the problems considered (with the exception of a standard least squares problem, for which we know learned sketching performs well). <sep>	weakness
2021-2025	The paper is recommended to be rejected, as the theory is weak, and the empirical results are borderline.	decision

2021-2045	This paper is a systematic study of how assumptions that are present recent theoretical meta-learning bounds are satisfied in practical methods, and whether promoting these assumptions (by adding appropriate regularization terms) can improve performance of existing methods.	abstract
2021-2045	The authors review common themes in theoretical frameworks for a meta learning setting that involves a feature learning step, based on which linear predictors for a variety of tasks are trained.	abstract
2021-2045	Statistical guarantees for such a framework (that is, statistical guarantees for the performance of trained on an additional target task) are based on the assumption that the set of weight vectors of the linear predictors span the space (ie exhibit variety) and that the training tasks all enjoy a similar margin separability (that is, that the representation is not significantly better suited for some of the tasks than others). <sep>	abstract
2021-2045	The current submission, cleanly reviews the existing literature, distills out these two properties and then proposes a regularization framework (that could be added to various meta-learning algorithms) to promote these properties in the learned feature representation. <sep>	abstract
2021-2045	Finally, the authors experimentally evaluate to what degree the properties are already observed by some meta learning methods, and whether the proposed additions will improve performance.	abstract
2021-2045	It is established that adding the regularization terms improves performance on most tasks.	abstract
2021-2045	The authors thus argue that incorporating insights obtained form recent theoretical frameworks of analysis, can lead to improved performance in practice.	abstract
2021-2045	Naturally, the purpose of the presented results is not to establish a new state of the art on a set of benchmark tasks, but to systematically study and compare the effect of adding regularization terms that will promote the properties that are desirable for a  feature representation based on statistical bounds. <sep>	abstract
2021-2045	I would argue that the research community should support this type of studies.	misc
2021-2045	The work is well presented and conducted.	strength
2021-2045	Most importantly, the study has a clear and general message, that will be valuable for researchers and practitioners working in on meta-learning. <sep>	strength

2021-2056	This paper evaluates the extent to which disentangled representations can be recovered from pre-trained GANs with style-based generators by finding an orthogonal basis in the space of style vectors, and then training an encoder to map images to coordinates in the resulting latent space.	abstract
2021-2056	To construct the orthogonal basis, the authors consider 3 recently proposed methods for controllable generation, along with a newly developed generalization of one of these methods.	abstract

2021-2056	Having read the paper, the metareviewer feels this submission indeed has strengths and weaknesses.	misc
2021-2056	On the one hand, the main results are notable; it is worth reporting that disentangled representations can be recovered from pretrained GANs is a relatively straightforward manner.	strength
2021-2056	In this context, the metareviewer feels that some comments by R4 are more critical than is warranted.	ac_disagreement
2021-2056	The authors do not necessarily have to show that GAN-based methods uniformly improve upon VAE-based methods, either in terms of disentanglement metrics or in terms of sensitivity to hyperparameters.	ac_disagreement
2021-2056	The main claim in this submission is that GAN-based methods are mostly comparable to VAE-based methods, and this claim is both sufficiently notable and sufficiently supported by experimental results. <sep>	ac_disagreement
2021-2056	At the same time, this submission is not without flaws.	weakness
2021-2056	The writing is on the rough side, and as R4 notes the authors have removed all white space between paragraphs.	weakness
2021-2056	The metareviewer also feels it is not satisfactory to show a box plot for GAN-based methods in Figure 2 and ask the reader to compare these plots to the violin plots for VAE-based methods in the Locatello paper.	weakness
2021-2056	The authors need to find a way to make a more direct comparison here.	suggestion
2021-2056	R4's comments about the comparison in the abstract-reasoning setting are also well-taken –– here the baseline employs standard (entangled) models, so it is unclear what conclusions we should draw from this experiment.	weakness
2021-2056	Similarly the unfairness results once again appeal to an indirect comparison to results in the  Locatello paper on this topic. <sep>	weakness
2021-2056	On balance, the metareviewer is inclined to say that this submission, in its current form, falls just below the threshold for acceptance.	decision
2021-2056	These results are clearly of note to the community and worth reporting, but the presentation has enough flaws that another round of reviews is warranted based on a revised manuscript.	weakness
2021-2056	The metareviewer hopes to see this paper appear a conference in the (near) future.	decision

2021-2058	All four knowledgeable referees have indicated reject due to many concerns.	rating_summary
2021-2058	In particular, reviewers pointed out that the novelty of this paper is not clear because the difference from related work is very limited (ie, the difference from Z. Wang and S. Ji is not clear, other than using one additional layer),  and they were concerned that the results of the experiment are not convincing (For example, the results reported in this paper are significantly inferior to those reported in other papers, the GNN architecture used is limited, and the performance difference especially in the additional experiments in the revision, is very marginal).	weakness
2021-2058	No reviewers were convinced by the authors' claims even through the author's rebuttal and revision. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2058	One important note: Reviewers have stated that they did not explicitly check the identity of the author and did not pose a problem on this, but if we follow the link specified in the original submission, we can see the identity of the author, which may be considered as a violation of the double-blind policy.	weakness
2021-2058	This is a small and regrettable mistake, but it can be a serious problem in the review process.	weakness
2021-2058	In this review process, reviewers unanimously suggested rejection even ignoring this issue, but it seems that you need to pay attention in your future submissions.	rating_summary

2021-2068	There was fairly detailed discussion among three of the four reviewers.	misc
2021-2068	The fundamental concern of the reviewers is regarding the contribution of the paper.	weakness
2021-2068	During the rebuttal, the authors clarified the following: <sep> 	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	while the effects of varying uncertainty / horizon lengths is well-understood for Bayes-optimal policies, it is not understood for existing meta-RL approaches, which is the topic of this paper<sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	That is, the contribution of the paper is to understand the effects of varying uncertainty/horizon lengths for meta-RL approaches.	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	However, it is known in prior work that meta-RL algorithms such as RL^2 can implement Bayes-optimal policies in principle.	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	As a result, it's not clear whether this contribution is significant relative to prior knowledge, and this paper does not seem to bring any new insights. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	An alternative framing of the paper would be to consider the question of how meta-RL solutions compare to Bayes-adaptive optimal policies.	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	While this framing would be interesting and novel, the current version of the paper does not sufficiently answer this question, since the only experiments include RL^2 (and such a study would require experimenting with more sophisticated meta-RL algorithms beyond RL^2). <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2068	As such, this paper isn't suitable for publication at *CONF* in its current form.	decision

2021-2080	The paper addresses learning with noisy labels, by detecting and correcting samples with noisy labels.	abstract
2021-2080	Reviewers had concerns about the empirical evaluations, specifically about comparing to additional methods, about hyperparameter tuning, and about the improvements being vey small.	weakness

2021-2094	Reviewer #2 has written a nice summary of the paper which I quote below. <sep>	misc
2021-2094	"The core idea is simple - which is a strength in my view - and does not require retraining the base language model, which could be important as language models become more expensive to train.	strength
2021-2094	However, the clarity and experiments in this paper fall short: the experimental setup has issues, the effect on perplexity is quite large but relegated to the Appendix, several claims are speculative and lacking corresponding experimental evidence, and it is unclear how the additional heuristics affect performance. <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	The method seems promising, but with the current experiments it is difficult to draw conclusions about how the method affects performance and which parts of it are necessary; given that this is an empirical paper, I would therefore not recommend acceptance in its current form." <sep>	decision

2021-2094	Reviewer #1: ""how did you measure model confidence about the toxicity label" <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	Reviewer #4: The perplexity gets much worse as the gedi training is introduced (ie Λ decreases), eg going from 25 to 45 on IMDb.	weakness
2021-2094	This result is in the Appendix, and perplexity is never evaluated/reported in the other experiments. <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	Reviewer #4: Crucially, the GEDI training does not appear to help over just re-weighting with the conditional LM ( vs. ).	weakness

2021-2094	Why was medium used instead of small?	weakness
2021-2094	What if large was used?	weakness
2021-2094	Does the conditional LM need to be a large-scale pretrained model (it would be nice to see a baseline of a simpler conditional LM)? <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	Several heuristics are used:  weighting, nucleus filtering, keeping tokens over a threshold, repetition penalty, and rescaling the logits to positive (used in only one experiment). <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	How does each of these affect performance?	weakness
2021-2094	There are no ablations, and given the small differences in some of the experiments it is unclear whether performance would actually be worse if we changed one of the heuristics.	weakness
2021-2094	One outcome may be that the method only works for a careful balance of hyperparameters, which could be fine, but we don't have a sense of the variation. <sep>	weakness
2021-2094	Reviewer #2: The output in Table 6 makes me doubt how the experiments are badly controlled.	weakness
2021-2094	The outputs from positive and negative sentiment are totally different and almost random text, meaning that the content of the generators is not controlled properly.	weakness

2021-2119	The reviewers had some initial concerns about this submission.	rebuttal_process
2021-2119	While the authors' rebuttal does a good job to address these concerns, the reviewers still have some doubts about the contribution of this paper and potential impact.	rebuttal_process
2021-2119	In particular, it is not clear whether the performance improvements observed with the proposed algorithms is due to the ability to correct for noisy rewards or whether there are multiple other explanations for the improvement in performance.	rebuttal_process

2021-2167	The three components are reasonably tightly-coupled and comprise a complete algorithm.	strength
2021-2167	However, the sequential-AdaQuant distracts the main claim of this work significantly.	weakness
2021-2167	This is probably added during the review process but looks ad-hoc to me.	weakness
2021-2167	Sequential AdaQuant seems to be effective to improve accuracy, but cannot be applied before the bit allocation was set, which makes it require integer programming no more.	weakness
2021-2167	Because of this issue, the overall presentation becomes confusing and the argument sometimes sounds unfair (please refer to the last posting by R5. ). <sep>	weakness
2021-2167	In addition, the presentation of this paper could be improved, especially for the details of the integer programming formulation.	weakness
2021-2167	It is not clear how to define some variables mathematically.	weakness
2021-2167	The discussion about the size of the calibration set together with the overfitting issue is lacking, and rigorous discussion and analysis would make the paper much stronger.	weakness
2021-2167	The reviewers are not convinced of the novelty of this paper, and they rather believe that this is an engineering-oriented work.	weakness
2021-2167	Considering this fact,  the evaluation of this paper is not very comprehensive.	weakness
2021-2167	The ablation study with respect to the size of the calibration set should be conducted more intensively.	weakness
2021-2167	The experiment fails to show the benefit of mixed precision quantization effectively and it is limited to presenting the compression ratio in Figure 3.	weakness
2021-2167	The authors used a small calibration set taken from the training dataset, which looks weird because they claim that the post-training quantization requires only a small "unlabeled" calibration set at the beginning of the abstract; it is more desirable to use arbitrary examples in the same domain. <sep>	weakness
2021-2167	Despite the interesting aspects, I believe that this paper needs a focus and substantial improvement for publication, and, consequently, recommend rejection.	decision

2021-2186	The paper considers exploiting low-rank structure in Q-function and the Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) to approximate the expectation in Q-learning to reduce the stochastic approxiamtion error, and thus, achieves "efficient RL".	abstract
2021-2186	The authors tested the algorithm empirically within some simple environments. <sep>	abstract
2021-2186	As reviewers (R1, R3, R4) mentioned, the major bottleneck of this algorithm is the assumption that the dynamics is known up to a constant, which is extremly strong, and thus, limits the application of the algorithm.	weakness
2021-2186	I suggest the authors to consider the common RL setting, without any knowledge about the transition models, and make fair empirical comparison with baselines in the same setting.	suggestion

2021-2188	The authors address the problem of self-supervised monocular depth estimation via training with only monocular videos.	abstract
2021-2188	They propose to use additional information extracted from semantic segmentation at training time to (i) provide additional "semantic context" supervision and (ii) to improve depth estimation at discontinuities through an edge guided point sampling based approach.	abstract
2021-2188	Results are presented on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets. <sep>	abstract
2021-2188	One of the main concerns is related to the utility of the semantic supervision given the relative cost required to obtain semantic training data in the first place.	weakness
2021-2188	The authors state that "the pixel-wise local depth information can not be well represented by current depth network".	abstract
2021-2188	However, Guizilini 2020a can generate detailed depth edges and they do NOT require any semantic information during training.	weakness
2021-2188	The authors also state that "the required labeled semantic dataset only accounts for a very tiny proportion, which indicates a relatively lower cost."	abstract
2021-2188	This is a bit misleading.	weakness
2021-2188	The proposed method uses per pixel semantic ground truth from three datasets (Mapillary Vistas, Cityscapes, and KITTI).	abstract
2021-2188	It takes a lot of effort to provide this ground truth compared to self-supervised methods which do not require any ground truth depth.	weakness
2021-2188	It is encouraging that dataset specific semantic finetuning does not seem to have a large impact (Table 3), but this still requires access to a large enough initial semantic training set.	weakness
2021-2188	Finally, the quantitative results are not much better than methods that don't require any semantics eg Guizilini 2020a, Johnston and Carneiro.	weakness
2021-2188	Clearly, methods that do not require semantics are much more scalable, especially when adapting to new types of scenes. <sep>	weakness
2021-2188	Regarding the specific contributions of the paper, the SEEM module is the most novel component of the model.	strength
2021-2188	However, the addition of the SEEM module does not improve quantitative performance by much (see Table 2).	weakness
2021-2188	In addition, the qualitative improvement it provides is also very subtle.	weakness
2021-2188	This can be seen by comparing the last two rows of Fig 7 ie without and with.	weakness
2021-2188	The authors need to make a stronger case, either quantitatively or qualitatively, as to why this is valuable. <sep>	abstract
2021-2188	Finally, but only a minor concern, the following relevant reference is missing: Jiao et al Look Deeper into Depth: Monocular Depth Estimation with Semantic Booster and Attention-Driven Loss, ECCV 2018 <sep>	weakness
2021-2188	In conclusion, there were mixed views from the reviewers - with some supportive of the paper (R2&3) others not as enthusiastic (R1&4).	rating_summary
2021-2188	The authors should be commended for their detailed responses and changes already made based on reviewer comments and suggestions.	rebuttal_process
2021-2188	Unfortunately, this did not change the mind of the reviewers.	rebuttal_process
2021-2188	It is the opinion of this AC that there is still more work required to fully show the utility of the proposed approach, especially considering the non trivial effort that is required to obtain semantic supervision in novel domains.	weakness

2021-2213	I think we did learn something new from this paper, and I think the reviewers all seem to agree with this. <sep>	strength
2021-2213	The observation you make about the objective seems correct and interesting (though reviewers and ACs do sometime miss errors), but I have the following complaints that keep me from recommending acceptance: <sep> 	decision
2021-2213	The theory seems right, but in practice, all sorts of GANs with all sorts of objective functions experience "mode collapse", <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	so it doesn't seem like the issue you point out w/ the NS-GAN objective can be the whole story. <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	However, we generally don't ask of a paper that it tells the whole story all in one go...<sep>	weakness
2021-2213	I do think the experiments are somewhat poorly done (compared to those for say the median paper about GANs that gets accepted to one of these conferences).	weakness
2021-2213	Moreover, many people have made similar experimental claims to the ones that are in this paper that haven't held up on more complicated data sets, so I tend to apply more scrutiny to such claims when they're only evaluated on smaller tasks.<sep>	weakness
2021-2213	There have, as R3 points out, been a huge number of papers proposing tricks for training GANs, and some of them work really well. <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	What I'm missing from this paper is an exploration of the relationship between your observation and those (mostly ad-hoc) tricks. <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	Does your observation explain why those tricks are necessary? <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	Does it explain why some existing trick works as well as it does? <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	If your observation is totally orthogonal to existing tricks, can you get much better performance on a challenging data set by using it? <sep>	weakness
2021-2213	I don't feel like I got satisfactory answers to those questions.<sep>	weakness
2021-2213	All this being said, the paper was borderline, and I think if you dealt with some of the complaints above you would have a pretty good shot of getting a revised version accepted at another major machine learning conference.	decision

2021-2225	I thank the authors for their submission and very active participation in the author response period.	misc
2021-2225	I want to start by stating that I rank the paper higher as is currently reflected in the average score of the reviewers.	misc
2021-2225	The reasons for this are that a) R2 and R3, while responding to the author's rebuttal, do not seem to have updated their score or indicated that they want to keep their initial assessment of the paper -- in particular, R2 has acknowledged that additional experiments by the authors were useful and results on KeyCorridorS4/S5R3 are nice, and b) I disagree with R2's sentiment that MiniGrid is not a suitable testbed -- it is by now an established benchmark for evaluating RL exploration and representation learning methods (see list of publications on https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid).	ac_disagreement
2021-2225	However, despite my more positive stance on the paper, I fully agree with R1 and R2 that a comparison to EC is needed in order to shed light into which factors of EC-SimCLR actually led to improvements in comparison to RIDE.	weakness
2021-2225	I therefore recommend rejection, but I strongly encourage the authors to take the feedback from the reviewers and work on a revised submission to the next venue.	decision

2021-2228	The paper analyzes connections between algorithmic fairness and domain generalization literatures.	abstract
2021-2228	The reviewers found the paper interesting but they also raised some important concerns about it. <sep>	misc
2021-2228	The applicability of the method presented in the paper is not clear nor well-discussed in the paper. <sep>	weakness
2021-2228	The papers and the revised version do not not cite important related work. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2228	The mathematical exposition in the paper is a bit hard to read.	rebuttal_process
2021-2228	Even after revision, the reviewers find part of the paper(Appendix F) very hard to read. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2228	Overall, the paper in the current version is below the high acceptance bar of *CONF*.	decision

2021-2251	This paper studies how to efficiently expose failures of "top-performing" segmentation models in the real world and how to leverage such counterexamples to rectify the models.	abstract
2021-2251	The key idea is to discover most "controversial" samples from massive online unlabeled images.	abstract
2021-2251	The approach is sound, well grounded, and quite logical.	strength
2021-2251	Results demonstrate the effectiveness. <sep>	strength
2021-2251	However, there exists some limitations coming from R2 and R3, for example, 1) Segmentation benchmarks may not require pixel-level dense annotation.	weakness
2021-2251	There are also examples of benchmarks where the groundtruth consists of computer segmentations corrected by humans.	weakness
2021-2251	2) It is much harder for segmentation data to be class-balanced in the pixel level, making highly skewed class distributions common for this particular task.	weakness
2021-2251	3) Citing the field of computer-assisted annotation as relevant work. <sep>	weakness
2021-2251	In the end, I think that this paper may not be ready for publication at *CONF*, but the next version must be a strong paper if above limitations can be well addressed.	decision

2021-2264	The reviewers are in consensus that the manuscript is not ready for publication in its current form: more comprehensive evaluation, and careful analysis (either theoretical or empirical) of the simple-but-effective methodology would improve the quality further.	rating_summary

2021-2276	The authors propose a particle-based entropy estimate for intrinsic motivation for pre-training an RL agent to then perform in an environment with rewards.	abstract
2021-2276	As the reviewers discussed, and also mentioned in their reviews, this paper bears stark similarity to work of 5 months ago, presented at the ICML 2020 Lifelong ML workshop, namely, "A Policy Gradient Method for Task-Agnostic Exploration", Mutti et al, 2020--MEPOL.	weakness
2021-2276	What is novel here is the adaptation of this entropy estimate to form an intrinsic reward via a contrastive representation and the subsequent demonstration on standardized RL environments.	strength
2021-2276	The authors have added a comparison to MEPOL, and in these experiments, APT outperforms this method, sometimes by some margin.	rebuttal_process
2021-2276	Unfortunately this work does not meet the bar for acceptance relative to other submissions.	decision

2021-2329	This paper presents a novel approach to grammar induction.	abstract
2021-2329	Like older work by Klein and Manning, the paper finds benefit in jointly inducing both constituency and dependency structure.	abstract
2021-2329	However, unlike most approaches to grammar induction, the model is not generative -- rather, it is a transformer-based architecture that is trained to optimize a masked language modeling objective.	abstract
2021-2329	The resulting parses appear to beat non-trivial baselines, but direct comparisons with several relevant state-of-the-art systems are not drawn.	weakness
2021-2329	Reviewers overall found the approach interesting and novel.	strength
2021-2329	However, nearly all reviewers raised serious concerns about experimental comparisons with related work and brought up several missing state-of-the-art baselines that, like the proposed system, do not require gold POS.	weakness
2021-2329	Reviewers also pointed out issues with clarity in several sections.	weakness
2021-2329	In rebuttal, authors provide a substantial update to the original draft.	rebuttal_process
2021-2329	So substantial that all reviewers mentioned in discussion that the new draft would effectively require an entirely new review.	rebuttal_process
2021-2329	While I applaud authors for the substantial revisions, and while *CONF* guidelines do not explicitly limit the amount change to a draft allowed in rebuttal, in this case the revisions are sufficiently drastic that I agree with reviewers that a new review process is required.	rebuttal_process
2021-2329	Thus, I recommend rejection but strongly encourage authors to resubmit.	decision

2021-2330	The work focuses on a new method for sampling hyper-parameter based on an "Population-Based Training" schedule that tend to sample more often configurations that gave good performances in the past.	abstract

2021-2342	This paper proposes two mechanisms, SelfNorm (used during training and inference) leveraging an attention-based recalibration of mean and standard deviation for instance normalization, and CrossNorm which performs cross-channel swapping of mean/stdev.	abstract
2021-2342	Is is shown that the combination (often combined with AugMix) performs well across several datasets in terms of model robustness.	abstract
2021-2342	Overall the paper has strength in the fact that the method is interesting, simple to implement, and modular.	strength
2021-2342	However, reviewers brought up a number of issues including the overstated motivation/writing, lack of clarity, and most importantly need for clear experimental results (comparing to uniform/standard baselines) and identification of the separate mechanisms.	weakness
2021-2342	It is especially uncertain why it is necessary that they are used together (often with AuxMix as well) to obtain the strong performance.	weakness
2021-2342	As a result, the score for this paper is borderline, tending towards a weak acceptance. <sep>	rating_summary
2021-2342	It is appreciated that the authors provided a lengthy rebuttal, including new results in a different domain (NLP); however, the reviewers agreed that not all of the concerns were addressed.	rebuttal_process
2021-2342	After a lengthy discussion, all of the reviewers agree that while the method is simple, modular, and effective when combined (hence the positive scores from some reviewers), the authors fail to describe the underlying reason for the method's gains, especially with respect to the individual parts (SelfNorm vs. CrossNorm) and why the results only come when these rather independently derived modules are used together.	rebuttal_process
2021-2342	The exposition of the experimental results, with differing baselines/conditions that make it very hard to understand where the effect is coming from, exacerbates this issue. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2342	As a result of these concerns, I recommend rejection of this paper.	decision
2021-2342	However, the method is interesting and results promising, so I hope that the authors can clarify the writing and improve the presentation of the results (specifically separating out the effects of SelfNorm and CrossNorm, as well as analyzing how they interact together to improve results) and submit to a future venue.	suggestion

2021-2347	The paper proposes a deep learning approach to blind image denoising based on deep unrolling.	abstract
2021-2347	In particular, the proposed network is derived from convolutional sparse coding algorithms, which are unrolled, untied across layers and learned from data.	abstract
2021-2347	The paper proposes a frequency domain regularization scheme in which the filters consist of a single analytically defined low-pass filter and a large collection of filters which are constrained to reside in the mid-to-high frequency ranges.	abstract
2021-2347	It also proposes to tie the thresholds in the soft-thresholding stages of the learned network to estimates of the noise variance, making the proposed scheme more robust to variations in the noise level. <sep>	abstract
2021-2347	Pros and Cons: <sep> [+] Having a single low-pass dictionary atom reduces redundancy (and potentially coherence) in the learned dictionary.	strength
2021-2347	This type of regularization may also reduce the time/data required to learn. <sep>	strength
2021-2347	[+/-] Using noise estimators and a noise adaptive threshold renders the model more robust to variations in the noise level.	strength
2021-2347	This is important, since in most denoising applications the noise level is not known a-priori.	strength
2021-2347	As the reviewers note, the idea of tuning thresholds in an unrolled sparse coding method based on the noise level is not a novelty of the paper; the novelty here is coupling this with a wavelet-based estimate of the noise level. <sep>	strength
2021-2347	[-] All three reviewers raise concerns regarding the novelty of the work compared to existing convolutional sparse coding-based neural networks.	weakness
2021-2347	The structure of the network is similar; the main difference is the frequency restriction for learned atoms, which is enforced by prefiltering the learned atoms with a high-pass filter. <sep>	weakness
2021-2347	[-] The paper is not entirely clear in its motivation and argumentation.	weakness
2021-2347	Reducing the coherence of the learned dictionary makes sense from the perspective of certain worst case results from sparse approximation.	weakness
2021-2347	However, the coherence is a worst case quantity; moreover, certain approaches to coherence control (eg, using large stride) control coherence at the expense of the expressiveness of the dictionary, and hence may not actually improve its ability to provide sparse reconstructions of natural signals.	weakness
2021-2347	The proposed frequency domain regularization is a sensible approach to controlling coherence, since low-frequency atoms will tend to be highly coherent, but would benefit from a crisper analytical motivation. <sep>	weakness
2021-2347	[-] Reviewers found the experiments lacking in some regards.	weakness
2021-2347	In particular, the paper only evaluates its proposals on synthetic experiments with Gaussian noise.	weakness
2021-2347	While this is in line with some previous work on deep learning based denoising, more extensive and realistic experiments would have bolstered the paper's argument. <sep>	weakness
2021-2347	Overall, the paper makes a sensible proposal regarding the adaptivity to unknown noise levels, and introduces a potentially useful frequency-domain restriction on the learned filters in a CSC network.	strength
2021-2347	However, the reviewers did not find that the paper made a clear argument for the significance of these proposals, and raised other concerns regarding the clarity and experiments.	weakness
2021-2347	The consensus of the reviewers is to recommend rejection.	rating_summary

2021-2353	For many problems such as ligand-protein binding, quantitative structure activity prediction (QSAR), predicting protein function from structure, etc., the 3D geometry of the molecules is of great importance.	abstract
2021-2353	One way to represent this is simply to assign locations to all atoms in 3-dimensional space.	abstract
2021-2353	If using graph convolutional kernels or other relational representations such that aligning molecules is not necessary, these approaches with 3D geometry can be efficient and far more effective than 1D or 2D representations.	abstract
2021-2353	The contribution of the paper is to make this point and to produce a resource with this kind of 3D data.	strength
2021-2353	Such a resource would be of high value.	strength
2021-2353	Nevertheless, reviewers feel provision of such a resource is perhaps not a major contribution to the *CONF* and ML communities.	weakness
2021-2353	There is a sense that more innovative and substantial contribution would come from addressing also the challenge that 3D geometry can changes and that there may be multiple low-energy conformations of biomolecules that should be considered.	suggestion
2021-2353	The authors contend that unlike ligands which are small and may have many low-energy conformations, large biomolecules have a much more constrained conformational space. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2353	This meta-reviewer is sympathetic to the authors' point and appreciates the importance of the resource.	rebuttal_process
2021-2353	Nevertheless, even large biomolecules often have some portions of flexible conformation and high 3D structure variation that should be considered.	rebuttal_process
2021-2353	And indeed addressing the kind of multiple instance problem that arises by considering multiple conformations of large molecules or of ligands binding to large molecules would certainly require and likely yield bigger *CONF*/ML innovations.	rebuttal_process
2021-2353	In the end the paper contributes a useful resource but does not excite the reviewers substantially enough, without those extensions or others, for a recommendation of acceptance at this time.	decision

2021-2397	The main concerns include ad-hoc choices of algorithm design, lack of algorithm novelty, not adequate experiments in illustrating the performance, etc.	weakness
2021-2397	During the rebuttal, the authors made efforts to response to all reviewers' comments.	rebuttal_process
2021-2397	However, the major concerns remain, and the rating were not changed.	rebuttal_process

2021-2399	Although the paper studies a relevant and important topic, which is about learning of hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised manner, the reviewers raised several critical concerns.	strength
2021-2399	In particular, although the hierarchical structure of concepts is the key idea in this paper, the concept of hierarchy itself is not well explained.	weakness
2021-2399	How to define the hierarchical level of concepts should be carefully and mathematically discussed.	weakness
2021-2399	In addition, empirical evaluation is not thorough as reviewers pointed out.	weakness
2021-2399	Although we acknowledge that the authors addressed concerns by the author response, newly added results are still confusing and more careful treatment is needed before publication.	rebuttal_process
2021-2399	I will therefore reject the paper. <sep>	decision
2021-2399	This work reminds me the the topic called "formal concept analysis" (eg see [1]), which mathematically defines concepts as closed sets and constructs a hierarchy of concepts in an unsupervised manner.	misc

2021-2409	(a) The result in Theorem 4.1 needs to be contrasted with a single machine setting: do we improve the convergence rate in terms of T here?	weakness
2021-2409	do we improve the constants in terms of L and M here?	suggestion
2021-2409	What is the advantage one can read off from Theorem 4.1, compared to a single machine implementation?	suggestion
2021-2409	How should we interpret the dependence of (optimal) H on r and lambda_2? <sep>	suggestion
2021-2409	(b) The justification for T≥n4 is a bit  weak and requires more thoughts: one applies distributed SGD because n is large.	weakness
2021-2409	What happens if T does not satisfy this condition in practice, as in the experiments? <sep>	suggestion
2021-2409	(c) Extension 1 perhaps should be more detailed as its setting is much more realistic than Theorem 1.	weakness
2021-2409	One could use Theorem 1 to motivate and explain some high level ideas but the focus should be on Extension 1-3.	suggestion
2021-2409	In extension 2, the final bound seems to be exactly the same as in Theorem 1, except a new condition on T. Any explanations?	suggestion
2021-2409	Why asynchronous updates only require a larger number of interactions but retain the same bound?	suggestion
2021-2409	These explanations would make the obtained theoretical results more accessible and easier to interpret.	suggestion

2021-2412	All reviewers agree that this paper is interesting, but needs improvement in order to be suitable for a highly competitive venue such as *CONF*.	rating_summary
2021-2412	Reviewer 3 is especially incisive and detailed, but other reviewers make similar points.	misc

2021-2430	Well, this paper has achieved something remarkable in this review process:  The initial scores came in at fairly low scores (4, 5, 3, 6).	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	However, as the discussions / rebuttals went back and forth, the reviewers were able understand and see the merits of the proposed methodology.	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	Namely, the setting of L2E (Learning to Exploit), which makes use of a novel method called Opponent Strategy Generation, to quickly generate very different types of opponents to play against.	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	One more pertinent component is the use of MMD (maximum mean discrepancy regularization) which can remove the necessity of dealing with task distributions, and does a better job in creating diverse opponents. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	Having understood the technical approach, three of the reviewers decided to substantially increase their scores.	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	R4 increased 4->6, R5 increased 5->6, R3 increased 3->4, while R2 held steady with a score of 6.	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	It was also good to see empirical favorable results compared to other baseline methods: L2E had the best return against unclear opponents, such as Rocks opponent and Nash opponent. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2430	Without any reviewer arguing strongly for acceptance, the program committee decided that the paper in its current form does not quite meet the bar, and also that it would benefit from another revision.	decision

2021-2443	The paper proposes a new meta-learning algorithm which promises greater robustness to adversarial examples.	abstract
2021-2443	I will be brief, as the fault with the paper is quite clear: the experimental results are not sufficient.	weakness
2021-2443	The attack used (FGSM) is particularly dated and weak, and the comparison to existing defences is insufficient.	weakness
2021-2443	Additionally, prior work (Adversarially Robust Few-Shot Learning: A Meta-Learning Approach) obtains better results, and is not compared against.	weakness
2021-2443	The reviewers provided further criticism regarding the motivation for and explanation of the method, but the empirical aspects of the paper are where it primarily falls short of the publishable standard for *CONF*. <sep>	weakness
2021-2443	I recommend rejection, and invite the authors to consider demonstrating robustness to a wider range of attacks (including non-gradient based), and a more thorough comparison to defence methods, before resubmitting to another conference.	decision

2021-2444	The paper proposes a method for offline meta-RL, where we meta-train on pre-collected offline data for several RL tasks and adapt to a new task with a small amount of data.	abstract
2021-2444	The paper assumes that there is no interaction with the environment either during meta-train or meta-test.	abstract
2021-2444	In this setting, motivated by the ide of leveraging offline experience from multiple tasks to enable fast adaptation to new tasks, the paper introduces MACAW, which combines the consistent MAML and the popular offline AWR, improving upon them by adding capacity through parameterization and adding an extra objective in the policy update.	abstract
2021-2444	As a result, the MACAW proposed for the offline meta-RL has the desirable property of being consistent, ie, converging to a good policy if enough time and data for the meta-test task are given, regardless of meta-training. <sep>	abstract
2021-2444	Pros: <sep> Most of the experiments are well executed, using good baselines.	strength
2021-2444	Extensive ablations on the various modifications to MAML+AWR confirmed the utility of the approach for the fully offline meta-RL problem. <sep>	strength
2021-2444	MACAW is a simple algorithm with theoretical guarantees; the modifications to the policy functions are backed by theory.<sep>	strength
2021-2444	Cons: <sep> The reviewers have concerns on the formulation of offline meta-RL.	weakness
2021-2444	One major contribution of the paper is to introduce offline meta-RL.	abstract
2021-2444	However the paper largely borrows the meta-RL formulation from the online setting where task=MDP.	weakness
2021-2444	The reviewers think that directly borrowing from regular meta-RL as the formulation of offline meta-RL might be misleading.	weakness
2021-2444	The reviewers suggest including behavior policy as part of the task definition for offline meta-RL formulation.<sep>	suggestion
2021-2444	Several reviewers raised concerns that the fully offline setting might be unrealistic.	weakness
2021-2444	Although the author did add a motivation, the reviewers would be interested in seeing MACAW being adapted online at test time on in-distribution tasks.<sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2444	Unfortunately, the authors accidentally revealed their names in one of the modified versions.	rebuttal_process

2021-2448	This paper investigates the topic of nondeterminism and instability in neural network optimization.	abstract
2021-2448	The reviewers found the results on different sources of nondeterminism particularly interesting and relevant.	strength
2021-2448	The experiments are carried on both language and also vision, which strengthens the findings.	strength
2021-2448	Concerns were raised about the use of smaller non-standard models, which were somewhat mitigated by the addition of Resnet-18 experiments on CIFAR.	weakness
2021-2448	The reviewers also noted that the measures used in the experimental protocol were already present in the literature, and that the proposed mitigation strategy is from another work.	weakness
2021-2448	Furthermore, R2 also found that the optimization instability section should be more developed.	weakness
2021-2448	The paper should be resubmitted with an improved discussion of related works and more developed section on instability as suggested by the reviewers.	decision

2021-2464	The new non linearity proposed in this paper present interesting observations and improvements on image and text datasets. <sep>	strength
2021-2464	However, reviewers point out that there should've been more comparisons to other efficient transformers and on more datasets. <sep>	weakness
2021-2464	The speed improvements are also not clear. <sep>	weakness
2021-2464	I'd encourage the authors to revise and submit in the future.	decision

2021-2470	This paper proposes an interesting collaborative multi-head attention (MHA) method to enable heads to share projections, which can reduce parameters and FLOPs of transformer-based models without hurting performance on En-De translation tasks.	abstract
2021-2470	For pre-trained language models, a tensor decomposition method is used to easily covert the original MHA to its collaborative version without retraining. <sep>	abstract
2021-2470	This paper receives 3 weak reject and 1 weak accept recommendations.	rating_summary
2021-2470	On one hand, all the reviewers agree that the paper is well motivated and the proposed idea is interesting.	strength
2021-2470	On the other hand, all the reviewers also commented that the current empirical results and comparisons are weak, which are not enough to support the paper's main claim.	weakness
2021-2470	From the current results, it is difficult to draw a conclusion that collaborative MHA is better. <sep>	weakness
2021-2470	Specifically, (i) From Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed method is not effective for pre-trained models, ie, even if the model size is not reduced much, the performance can be dropped significantly.	weakness
2021-2470	(ii) More experiments, such as QA, more translation/generated tasks will make this paper more convincing.	weakness
2021-2470	(iii) More rigorous experiments are needed to justify the practical value of the proposed method.	weakness
2021-2470	If the authors try to emphasize that they go beyond practical realm, then probably a careful re-positioning of the paper is needed, which may not be a trivial task. <sep>	suggestion
2021-2470	The rebuttal unfortunately did not fully address the reviewers' main concerns.	rebuttal_process
2021-2470	Therefore, the AC regrets that the paper cannot be recommended for acceptance at this time.	decision
2021-2470	The authors are encouraged to consider the reviewers' comments when revising the paper for submission elsewhere.	decision

2021-2503	Unfortunately some of the reviewers' reactions to the author feedback won't be visible to the authors. <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2503	The reviewers highly appreciated the replies and revision of the paper <sep>	rebuttal_process
2021-2503	Pros: <sep> The paper renders Generalized Exploration tractable for deep RL. <sep> 	strength
2021-2503	The idea is applicable to many DRL methods and is potentially very valuable to deal with the headaches associated to DRL.<sep>	strength
2021-2503	Cons: <sep> R2 and R4 are still concerned about whether 'smart' exploration will always be advantageous, and whether the added complexity is a good trade-off for the (potentially) better performance.	weakness
2021-2503	A comparison to 'pure' exploration would still be insightful. <sep>	weakness
2021-2503	the new 'SAC with Deep Coherent Exploration' only partially addresses the concerns of R2 and R4, especially in terms of performance<sep>	weakness
2021-2503	While the paper has improved drastically during the reviewing process, there are still a few too many doubts.	rebuttal_process

2021-2512	The paper provides an interesting set of theoretical ideas to improve the estimation of normalizing flows on datasets that fail to be fully dimensional.	abstract
2021-2512	Although the method is appealing, I believe the paper falls a bit short of acceptance at the conference.	decision
2021-2512	Too many practical issues are left out, as discussed by reviewers, and the method seems promising but not fully connected to the rest of the literature on estimating low-dimensional distributions living in high dimensional spaces.	weakness
2021-2512	We encourage the authors to use the feedback contained in this round of reviews to improve their work.	suggestion

2021-2515	Three reviewers have reviewed this manuscript, and they had severe reservations regarding the presentation quality and the lack of sufficient theoretical support behind empirical observations.	weakness
2021-2515	Even after rebuttal, the reviewers maintained that the above issues are not fully resolved.	rebuttal_process
2021-2515	Unfortunately, this paper cannot be accepted in its current form.	decision

2021-2533	This paper is certainly on the way to be a solid contribution: it's an interesting research question, and we need more understanding papers (rather than yet another algorithmic trick paper). <sep>	weakness
2021-2533	The reviewers thought the paper was not yet ready.	rating_summary
2021-2533	The reviewers suggested: (1) more motivation of why the proposed metrics were of interest, (2) clearer discussion and evidence of how the analysis better articulates the performance of PER, (3) missing empirical details like methodology for setting hyper-parameters, why these 9 Atari games, undefined errorbars, unspecified number of runs, and (4) conclusions not supported by evidence in Atari: with missing experiment details, likely too few runs, and overlapping errorbars in most games few scientific conclusions can be drawn. <sep>	suggestion
2021-2533	The work might be strengthen by developing the first part of the paper (and focussing on the reviewer's suggestions) and deemphasizing the novel algorithmic contribution part.	suggestion

2021-2545	The authors propose two linguistic verifiers for improving extractive question answering when the question is answerable.	abstract
2021-2545	The first replaces the interrogative in the question with candidate answers and evaluates the result both in isolation and in combination with the answer-containing sentence to do answer verification.	abstract
2021-2545	The second jointly encodes individual sentences and spans with questions in a hierarchical manner to improve use of context in answer prediction performance. <sep>	abstract
2021-2545	The reviews for this paper are roughly on the cusp: 2 reviewers rate the paper a bit below the acceptance threshold, 1 a bit above, and then 1 now rates the paper as a solid Accept. <sep>	rating_summary
2021-2545	Pros<sep> The main strength of the paper, certainly as emphasized by the most positive reviewer is the strong empirical results.	strength
2021-2545	Especially on SQuAD v2, the method here seems to roughly equal the current leading system on the leaderboard. <sep>	strength
2021-2545	The paper also proposes two methods for improving question answering that make sense, are relatively simple, and work<sep>	strength
2021-2545	Cons<sep> The writing and presentation of the paper is not that great.	weakness
2021-2545	Even at the level of the introduction, the writing just is not very focused: The first page has a lot of background and tutorial information on MRC that just doesn't get to the point of where this paper is situated and what it contributes. <sep>	weakness
2021-2545	Neither of the proposed systems are that novel (though it is interesting to see that they still have value even in the age of large contextual language models) <sep>	weakness
2021-2545	The paper lacks ML novelty <sep>	weakness
2021-2545	The methods appear to be significantly more expensive to run <sep>	weakness
2021-2545	Some empirical comparisons appear to be lacking<sep>	weakness
2021-2545	As well as the missing comparisons mentioned by some reviewers, I think that there are a number of other missing relevant datapoints.	weakness
2021-2545	While not denying that gathering the available results for NewsQA/TriviaQA is much less straightforward than with that nice leaderboard for SQuAD, aren't there are lot of systems with better results on TriviaQA that aren't mentioned in the paper.	weakness
2021-2545	These include: RoBERTa and SpanBERT (mandarjoshi); BigBird-ETC see https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/c8512d142a2d849725f31a9a7a361ab9-Paper.pdf; Longformer; SLQA see https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1158. pdf . <sep>	misc
2021-2545	But, overall, I think the decision on this paper comes down to focus and contributions.	misc
2021-2545	Not withstanding the growing size of *CONF*, I would like to think that it is not just another ML and ML applications conference, but it is a conference centered on representation learning.	misc
2021-2545	The present paper, no matter its quality and strong results, just isn't a contribution to representation learning.	weakness
2021-2545	It is a much better fit to an NLP conference where it would be a strong contribution to question answering, showing the continuing value of linguistic methods like question rewriting in answer validation.	decision
2021-2545	But this just isn't a contribution within the focus of representation learning.	weakness
2021-2545	Just as R4 does, I encourage the authors to clean up the presentation of the paper a bit and to submit it to an NLP conference, where it would be a strong contribution, for the reasons that R3 emphasizes.	decision

2021-2548	This paper studies the tensor principal component analysis problem, where we observe a tensor T = \\beta v^{\\otimes k} + Z where v is a spike and Z is a Gaussian noise tensor.	abstract
2021-2548	The goal is to recover an accurate estimate to the spike for as small a signal-to-noise ratio \\beta as possible.	abstract
2021-2548	There has been considerable interest in this problem, mainly coming from the statistics and theoretical computer science communities, and the best known algorithms succeed when \\beta \\geq n^{k/4} where n is the dimension of v. The main contribution of this paper is to leverage ideas from theoretical physics and build a matrix whose top eigenvector is correlated with v for sufficiently large \\beta using trace invariants.	abstract
2021-2548	On synthetic data, the algorithms achieve better performance than existing methods. <sep>	abstract
2021-2548	The main negative of this paper is that it is not so clear how tensor PCA is relevant in machine learning applications.	weakness
2021-2548	The authors gave some references to applications of tensor methods, but I want to point out that all of those works are about using tensor decompositions, which despite the fact that they are both about tensors, are rather different sorts of tools.	weakness
2021-2548	Many of the reviewers also found the paper difficult to follow.	weakness
2021-2548	I do think exposition is particularly challenging when making connections between different communities, as this work needs to introduce several notions from theoretical physics.	weakness
2021-2548	I am also not sure how novel the methods are, since a somewhat recent paper Moitra and Wein, "Spectral Methods from Tensor Networks", STOC 2019 also uses tensor networks to build large matrices whose top eigenvalue is correlated with a planted signal, albeit for a different problem called orbit retrieval.	weakness

2021-2550	The paper studies the problem of satisfying group-based fairness constraints in the situation where some demographics are not available in the training dataset.	abstract
2021-2550	The paper proposes to disentangle the predictions from the demographic groups using adversarial distribution-matching on a "perfect batch" generated by a clustered context set. <sep>	abstract
2021-2550	Pros: <sep> The problem of satisfying statistical notions of fairness under "invisible demographics" is a new and well-motivated problem. <sep> 	strength
2021-2550	Creative use of recent works such as DeepSets and GANs applied to the fairness problem.<sep>	strength
2021-2550	Cons: <sep> Makes a strong assumption that the clustering of the context set will result in a partitioning that has information about the demographics.	weakness
2021-2550	This requires at the very least a well-behaved embedding of the data wrt the demographic groups, and a well-tuned clustering algorithm (where optimal tuning is difficult in practice on unsupervised problems) -- but at any rate, as presented, the requirements for a "perfect batch" is neither clear nor formalized. <sep>	weakness
2021-2550	Lack of theoretical guarantees. <sep>	weakness
2021-2550	Various concerns in the experimental results (ie proposed method does not clearly outperform other baselines, high variance in experimental results, and other clarifications).<sep>	weakness
2021-2550	Overall, the reviewers agreed the studied problem is new, interesting and relevant to algorithmic fairness; however, there were numerous concerns (see above) which were key reasons for rejection.	decision

2021-2553	This work proposes a novel reparameterization of batch normalization that is hypothesized to give a better inductive bias for learning several tasks, including neural architecture search, conditional image generation, adversarial robustness and neural style transfer.	abstract
2021-2553	The reviewers indicate that this is useful and is of interest to the *CONF* audience, but they are not satisfied with the analysis offered in the paper.	weakness
2021-2553	Specifically, the reviewers request that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of why the proposed reparameterization improves results, given that it does not change the expressive power of the model class.	weakness
2021-2553	Additionally, the reviewers have some concerns about the structure of the paper.	weakness
2021-2553	I therefore recommend rejecting the paper at this time.	decision

2021-2567	This paper introduces an object perception and control method for RL, derived from a control-as-inference formulation within a POMDP.	abstract
2021-2567	The paper provides a theoretical derivation and experiments where the proposed joint-inference approach outperforms baselines. <sep>	abstract
2021-2567	The discussion focussed on understanding the paper's contribution relative to prior work.	rebuttal_process
2021-2567	The reviewers highlighted the similarities with earlier systems (R1, R2, R4), the unclear benefits of joint inference over independently trained modules in the experiments (R3), and the lack of clarity of the presentation (R1, R2, R3).	rebuttal_process
2021-2567	The authors responded to some of these criticisms, bolstering the paper with additional experiments to show the benefits of joint inference and increasing the discussion of related work.	rebuttal_process
2021-2567	The reviewers examined the revisions and rebuttal and found the paper still did not resolve all their original concerns.	rebuttal_process
2021-2567	Two limitations mentioned in the final phase of the discussion were the use of a single environment to evaluate the general framework, and continuing doubts on the contribution of joint inference mechanism to the measured performance. <sep>	weakness
2021-2567	Four knowledgeable reviewers indicate reject as their concerns were not adequately resolved.	rebuttal_process
2021-2567	The paper is therefore rejected.	decision

2021-2595	The paper proposes to address the out-of-distribution generalization problem by means of conditional computation in form of a feature modulating module. <sep>	abstract
2021-2595	While the approach is interesting and brings a new take on how to perform feature modulation (although initially felt too similar to Conditional Batch Normalization) some major concerns about the experiments and validation of the approach are raised by all reviewers.	weakness
2021-2595	Some of the hypothesis made are also challenged due to lack of proper validation. <sep>	weakness
2021-2595	Although the discussion clarified some points I am afraid many open questions are left unanswered and would require a more work to be fully addressed before acceptance.	decision

2021-2608	This paper performs visual odometry using variational information bottleneck.	abstract
2021-2608	It assumes video and pose observations and aims to find a latent state that is maximally predictive of the pose observations, while minimizing the mutual information between the image observations and the latent state.	abstract
2021-2608	It approximates this cost using variational inference.	abstract
2021-2608	The paper also makes use of deterministic+stochastic latent transition models, as in Hafner et al 2019, 2020.	abstract
2021-2608	The paper contributes generalization bounds that are based on recent work by Xu and Raginsky 2017 and Zhang et al 2018.	abstract
2021-2608	This is useful to include, but this contribution is not the main focus of the work in my opinion, and it is not clear how tight the bounds are, especially considering that the original cost function is approximated. <sep>	weakness
2021-2608	Pros: <sep> The idea of using the deterministic+stochastic transition models of Hafner et al and related works for visual odometry is very interesting and promising avenue for research. <sep>	strength
2021-2608	The fact that the experiments are done on some of the major camera and IMU datasets is great. <sep>	strength
2021-2608	Needs fixing: <sep> Major: The paper mentions "Extensive ablation studies were conducted to examine the effects of (1) the deterministic component, (2) sample size and (3) extra sensors.".	weakness
2021-2608	These are great, but I would also have expected to see a range of variations in terms of the weight gamma, including a value of zero.	weakness
2021-2608	The appendix is vague in this regard and says " and perform a non-intensive and small-range grid searching."	weakness
2021-2608	The utility of the information bottleneck idea depends heavily on the weight gamma, and I would have liked more results confirming that the method does well under a range of choices for gamma. <sep>	weakness
2021-2608	Major: The rotation results produced by this method on EuroC should be improved to be more competitive with okvis.	weakness
2021-2608	As it stands, it is unclear why the method does not perform as well and the explanations offered in the paper are speculative. <sep>	weakness
2021-2608	Medium: The paper also mentions in the appendix: "Though 3D von Mises-Fisher distribution and 4D-Bingham distribution can be arguably more appropriate to model Euler angles and quaternions respectively, it is non-trivial to evaluate and use them for training in practice."	weakness
2021-2608	So, the paper represents rotations using Euler angles.	weakness
2021-2608	The authors are encouraged to look at https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/publication/202004-*CONF*-deep_orientation_uncertainty_learning/ <sep>	suggestion
2021-2608	Minor: MSCKF was originally coined by Mourikis and Roumeliotis https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642 and even though the term is used by follow-up works,  it is worth adding the reference. <sep>	weakness
2021-2608	Finally, I would disagree with one of the reviewers that this paper needs to compare with ORBSLAM2.	ac_disagreement
2021-2608	I think comparing with OKVIS and an MSCKF variant is sufficient for "classic" SLAM and odometry methods. <sep>	ac_disagreement
2021-2608	I think the paper needs one more iteration to fix these issues, even though it is very promising work.	misc
